I"ª<p>Would you serve frozen turkey roll heated in a microwave to guests?</p>

<p>No. No, you would not. Proper Thanksgiving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY7hWPSbbw0&amp;t=0m59s">tradition</a> calls for a bespoke meal â€“ gravy made from turkey drippings in a cast-iron skillet, stuffing made from toasted and hand-torn bread, a freshly roasted golden-brown bird, and casserole made from canned soup, green beans and fried onions. Well, three out of four ainâ€™t bad.</p>

<p>Yet people buy millions of tons of <a href="http://www.oceanspray.com/Products/Sauce/Jellied-Cranberry-Sauce-(1).aspx">canned</a> cranberry sauce to serve to guests. This is not only sad but also very, very wrong. We serve  beloved family members <sup><a href="#footnote-one">1</a></sup> who have journeyed hours to be with us food the color of a late-stage diabeticâ€™s bloated limb. It slides out of the can and flops into a serving dish like dog food.</p>

<p>It sits there in the bowl in a watery purple puddle <em>still the shape of the container it came in.</em> If there is any food you could serve to your guests that says â€œI give zero fucksâ€ more than this Iâ€™m not sure what it would be. Twinkies? Slim Jims?</p>

<p>Despite all this evidence, often people say that they prefer canned sauce to homemade. Naturally everyone is a little bit different and we must cater to our guestsâ€™ wishes and accept that people have their own taste preferences, but people who prefer canned sauce are wrong and stupid.</p>

<p>If I ever come to power among my first acts after calling George Lucas to account for his many crimes would be to outlaw canned cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>Thanks to makers of cranberry sauce â€“ â€œBig Cranberryâ€ â€“ people are convinced that cranberry sauce is a mystical substance, as difficult and as complicated to pull off as a souffle or baked Alaska. Yet, proper cranberry sauce is by far the easiest part of the meal to prepare, far easier than  gravy or even mashed potatoes. <sup><a href="#footnote-three">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Here is the basic two-step recipe for making homemade cranberry sauce:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy a bag of cranberries.</li>
  <li>Follow the instructions on the bag.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I prefer to put my spin on the recipe.</p>

<ul>
  <li>One bag of fresh cranberries</li>
  <li>1 cup of orange juice</li>
  <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
  <li>A pinch of cloves</li>
  <li>About 1/4 tsp. or so of cinnamon. <sup><a href="#footnote-two">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Put the sugar, juice and spices into a saucepan. Bring to a vigorous boil. Dump in the cranberries. Bring back to a boil. The berries will pop  and reduce to sauce. After about 10 minutes your sauce should be done.</p>

<p>Press it through a strainer if you are one of those weird people who donâ€™t want the skins.</p>

<p>You will have several cups of beautiful crimson red cranberry sauce and a house filled with the lovely smell of cranberries and spices. You canâ€™t get that out of a can.</p>

  <li><span id="footnote-one"></span> Iâ€™m using a very loose definition of the word â€œbeloved.â€</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-two"></span> I never measure spices. I just put some in.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-three"></span> Which you are also probably making wrong.</li>
</ol>
