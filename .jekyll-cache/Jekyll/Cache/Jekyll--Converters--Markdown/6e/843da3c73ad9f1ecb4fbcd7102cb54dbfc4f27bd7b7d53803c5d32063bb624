I"z<p>One of the most poignant lines in all pop music I find in Weezer’s disposable ditty <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2MLHyLy5z5l5YRp7momlgw">Island in the Sun</a></em>.</p>

<p>The band caught a lot of criticism when the song came out. People said it sounded like Sugar Ray. That’s a fair criticism, musically. But I find the song more meaningful than anything on the soul-baring <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3jWhmYMAWw5NvHTTeiQtfl">Pinkerton</a></em> album.</p>

<p>Frontman Rivers Cuomo spent years battling crushing depression – the “put tinfoil on your windows and never leave your apartment for years” type. The hardcore type.</p>

<p>Wanting to be on an “island in the sun” isn’t just about a holiday week in the tropics. When he sings “We’ll never feel bad anymore,” it’s his deepest wish as well as one of life’s most impossible tasks.</p>

<p>How can you never feel bad any more? Truth is, you can’t.</p>

<p>I’m not actually here to critically re-evaluate mid-period Weezer. Earlier this week I <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/05/somewhere-thats-green.html">wrote</a> a short (for me) blog post about the first real day of spring – sunny, warm, flowers blooming, leaves finally on the trees.</p>

<p>Walking down a lovely sun-dappled street with tree limbs sagging with blossoms, it just felt good. I wanted to write about that. So, I did.</p>

<p>I caught some good-natured guff from friends about “what have you done with the real Putney!?” And, no, my site wasn’t hacked by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054195/?ref_=nv_sr_2">Pollyanna</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully the people who read it were on metaphor alert because it feels like, at least for now, winter is over.</p>

<p>For me, <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/01/2014----looking-back-looking-forward.html">2014</a> was an extremely rough year. I won’t bore you with details, but I came out of it thinking differently about happiness.</p>

<p>Namely, that happiness isn’t a state, but something that you get for a while. You don’t really own it. It’s like it’s on loan, but it’s not even that, really.</p>

<p>I liken it to money.</p>

<p>Twelve-year-old David couldn’t imagine the amount of money I have in my bank account on payday. Middle-aged me can’t imagine how little of that is left right before the next payday rolls around.</p>

<p>I don’t “have” money. I just passes my way temporarily.</p>

<p>That’s happiness for most people. You get it … <em>for a while</em>. You get to use it while you’ve got it.</p>

<p>And, the only way you can enjoy it – really enjoy it – is to traverse the tough times. After Boston’s cold, frozen wasteland of a winter, that bursting, blooming street somehow feels more special, like it was earned.</p>

<p>Right now just feels like a moment for me – an ephemeral spring day.</p>

<p>I’ll take that.</p>
