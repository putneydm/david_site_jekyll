I"à<p>Word of a new Bond movie is always welcome news.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://carrolltrustcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/yolt-osato-office.jpg">teaser trailer</a> for <em>Spectre</em> premiered online this weekend, with Christoph Waltz in a role he was born to play: Bond villain.</p>

<p>Thus begins the cycle of getting excited about a new Bond movie all over again. 2013â€™s teaser for <em>Skyfall</em> was superb, with a line that distills the Bond franchise perfectly: â€œSome men are coming to kill us. Weâ€™re going to kill them first.â€</p>

<p>The movie itself was a beautifully shot muddle, with Roger Deakinsâ€™ jaw-dropping cinematography â€“ the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUyrRn-9rEQ">fight</a> in front of a giant video screen is a masterpiece. But itâ€™s in service of a computer hacking plotline devised by someone who apparently learned how computers work by overhearing a drunk guy at a party.</p>

<p>As a film, itâ€™s visually arresting but strangely inert. Sam Mendes, a theater director, stages his scenes formally like entries and exits under a proscenium arch. And, wait a minute â€“ did this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAf3Mf2QPjA">MI6 guy</a> follow Bond from room to room as he trained to deliver one line of exposition in each?</p>

<p>Most troublingly, we were treated to yet another <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SissyVillain">swishy gay villain stereotype</a> that seems retrograde for 2013. Or at least should have been.</p>

<p>And while we are on the topic of gender politics, the movie â€“ spoiler alert â€“ kills off its female M â€“ the great Judi Dench â€“ and established that Moneypenny isnâ€™t suited for field work so she can ride a desk. The boys are back in charge of MI6 now.</p>

<p>None of this is really enough to cause worry. If <em>Casino Royale</em> proves anything, a truly great modern Bond movie can still be made. It isnâ€™t just the best Bond movie since the overrated <em>Goldfinger,</em> as some claim. Itâ€™s the best Bond movie, period.</p>

<p>The moviesâ€™ most enduring franchise doesnâ€™t seem to get tired. Or, at least tired permanently.</p>

<p>Bond is a unique franchise. <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> have to deal with considerable sprawling backstory and fans with a Taliban-like intolerance for the slightest continuity error. The 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> reboot dealt with this by <a href="http://www.trekbbs.com/showthread.php?t=75505">bulldozing</a> 50 years of <em>Star Trek</em> legacy out of existence through a time-travel conceit.</p>

<p>Just deal with it, fanboys.</p>

<p>The Bond franchise deals with its decades of backstory by not really caring. Bond lives in the eternal present. Surely Pierce Brosnanâ€™s â€™90s Bond wasnâ€™t the same guy who defeated Auric Goldfinger, but who really knows?</p>

<p>Relics of <a href="http://www.bashthemonkey.com/images/In_jokes/dad1.jpg">past movies</a> showed up in Qâ€™s laboratory in <em>Die Another Day,</em> but forget about any explanation of how they fit into Brosnan-era Bondâ€™s past.</p>

<p><em>Casino Royale</em> tried to deal with this by sending Bond on his first mission, but it put him back in his iconic <a href="http://uncrate.com/p/2010/06/64-aston-martin-db5-xl.jpg">1964 Aston Martin</a> spy car, which also returns in <em>Skyfall,</em> complete with its ejector seat button on the gear lever.</p>

<p>All this fits nicely with the <a href="http://fantheories.wikia.com/wiki/James_Bond">fan theory</a> that â€œJames Bondâ€ is just a code name, but thatâ€™s just fan guesswork.</p>

<p>Regardless of how the Bond movie universe works out its legacy, the end result is that every era gets a Bond it deserves.</p>

<p>You have sleek â€™60s Bond as a icon of cool wearing Don Draper suits and driving one of the most beautiful cars ever made. We get â€™70s Bond in <a href="http://i.ndtvimg.com/mt/movies/2012-09/roger-abuse.jpg">wide lapels</a> and a raised eyebrow as he slides through camptastic crap like <em>Moonraker</em> or, heaven forbid, wears a <a href="http://thesuitsofjamesbond.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Octopussy-Clown-Suit.jpg">clown costume</a> in <em>Octopussy.</em></p>

<p>The â€™90s saw an all-business Bond becoming yet another person to kill <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/11/the-many-deaths-of-sean-bean">Sean Bean</a> before kite surfing his way across a <a href="http://www.chud.com/articles/content_images/17/WorstCGI-Bond1.jpg">fake CGI wave</a> and back into full-on camp status.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s just be honest. For a beloved character, much legacy Bond hasnâ€™t aged well at all. The corkscrew car jump of <em>The Man With the Golden Gun</em> is one of the great car stunts in all of movies. But Bond is driving â€¦  <em>good lord, thatâ€™s an AMC Hornet!</em>  And the chase includes a terbacky-chewing cracker sheriff, Bond doing a Southern accent and a slide-whistle sound effect.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s painful to watch. <em>So please, letâ€™s.</em></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Other aspects have aged even worse. The entire plot of <em>Live and Let Die</em> comes across as irredeemably racist. Some Bond seduction scenes seem borderline rapey now.</p>

<p>Thanks to some amazing 1960â€™s era modernist <a href="http://carrolltrustcase.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/yolt-osato-office.jpg">set design</a> and avoidance of excess, Conneryâ€™s Bond fares best in avoiding some of the more embarrassing aspects, despite an occasional <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/38/45/f4/3845f4d0974ac26efffc3baf28940cf0.jpg">poor choice</a> by the wardrobe department or silly attempts to murder Bond on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KkSOqp3omA">back-stretching</a> machine in <em>Thunderball.</em></p>

<p>He even acquits himself in unofficial Bond movie <em>Never Say Never Again,</em> which avoids most of the camp and outright silliness that weighed down Bond in the â€™80s.</p>

<p>But none of this matters, not really, because the Bond franchise keeps moving forward. That Bond drove an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWlmUHjuQRo&amp;t=2m19s">amphibious gondola</a> through the streets of Venice as a pigeon  â€“ sigh â€“ did a double take didnâ€™t stop the producers from returning there for the third act showdown and tragedy of <em>Casino Royale.</em></p>

<p>As long as EON productions doesnâ€™t worry about Bondâ€™s past, they probably wonâ€™t have to worry about his future.</p>
