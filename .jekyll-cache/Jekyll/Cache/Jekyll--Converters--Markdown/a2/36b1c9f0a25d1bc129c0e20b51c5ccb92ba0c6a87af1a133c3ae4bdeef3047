I"²<p>Key lime pie is quite literally the very best thing that you can put in your mouthhole. <sup><a href="#footnote-one">1</a></sup> Well, <em>proper</em> key lime pie that is.</p>

<p>Restaurant key lime pie has left many with the impression that itâ€™s something with the consistency of primary school paste dyed <a href="http://assets.kraftfoods.com/recipe_images/opendeploy/51518_SGS_K2622V0_OR1_OH_640x428.jpg">nuclear green</a> and infused with lime-flavored petroleum distillates.</p>

<p>And, for god sakes, do not get your key lime pie out a <a href="https://jet.com/product/detail/16b9fbb5a8624618af1057c2500dae0d?jcmp=pla:ggl:a_jd_cons_gen_food_beverages_tobacco_a3_b1:food_items_cooking_baking_ingredients_a3_other:na:PLA_648191734_39624895024_pla-212814271984:na:na:na:2&amp;code=PLA15">can</a>.</p>

<p>This is America. We can do better. Granted, our presidential nomination process gave us a choice between a thin-lipped <a href="http://16004-presscdn-0-50.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/hillary-angry.jpg">scold</a> and a professional wrestling <a href="http://img.wonkette.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Donald-Trump_3372655k.jpg">announcer</a>. But key lime pie needs standards.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s one of those recipes thatâ€™s easier to make in its purest form. It doesnâ€™t take hours in the kitchen getting the specific gravity of a complex set of ingredients just right. Itâ€™s just a fairly simple list of ingredients that you mix together and bake. Itâ€™s easier to make than gravy.</p>

<p>The secret recipe for really great key lime pie is this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Buy Nellie &amp; Joeâ€™s key lime <a href="https://keylimejuice.com/">juice</a>. <sup><a href="#footnote-two">2</a></sup></li>
  <li>Make the recipe on the bottle.</li>
</ul>

<p>But this also smacks of settling, like listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoW3bqnr7tw">Hootie and Blowfish</a> or going on a date with me. A tweak here or there to the classic recipe can really make a difference.</p>

<h3 id="key-lime-pie-top-tip-no-1">Key Lime Pie Top Tip No. 1</h3>
<p>Use fresh <a href="https://lookimadethat.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/limes.jpg">key limes</a> if they are available. Itâ€™s better enough that itâ€™s worth the few minutes of extra effort. One bag is enough for one pie.</p>

<p>Squeezing 15 or so ping pong-ball-sized limes might seem a problem. Cut them in half and use a garlic press. It takes less than five minutes to do a whole bag.</p>

<p>The classic recipe calls for graham cracker crust. The best way to make a graham cracker crust is to take the box of crackers and throw them the hell out the window. Graham crackers are shit.</p>

<p>A crust of crushed-up vanilla wafers with a bit of shredded coconut adds a nice counterpoint to the sweet and tart pie filling.</p>

<p>So get <a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2DC1m7itrSgUKKZeHjGwUU?play=true&amp;utm_source=open.spotify.com&amp;utm_medium=open">this</a> playing on your hi-fi and letâ€™s go. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Three large handfuls of vanilla wafers.</li>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>One can of sweetened condensed milk</li>
  <li>Three eggs</li>
  <li>One bag of limes squeezed (about 2/3 of a cup or so)</li>
  <li>About 3/4 stick of butter, melted</li>
  <li>Shredded coconut</li>
</ul>

<p>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.</p>

<p>Crush the vanilla wafers. I generally put them in a large ziplock bag and roll them with a rolling pin until theyâ€™re cookie dust. You should end up with a cup or so. Add two or three tablespoons of sugar. <sup><a href="#footnote-three">3</a></sup> Add two or three heaping tablespoons of coconut.</p>

<p>Mix it all up and then pour in the melted butter as you stir the crumbs. Youâ€™ll need a little finesse here. The crumbs should stick in place if  pressed with a spoon, but not be drenched. You donâ€™t have to use all the butter.</p>

<p>Butter a 9-inch pie plate. Dump the crumbs into it and lightly press them in place with the back of a spoon until you have a reasonable facsimile of a pie crust. Pop it in the oven for 10 minutes. You can skip this prebaking step if you want your crust to be soggy shit that falls apart.</p>

<p>Mix the sweetened condensed milk, lovingly hand-squeezed lime juice and three egg yolks together. When the crust is done prebaking, dump the filling into the crust, jiggle it around a bit to level it and bake for 15 minutes.</p>

<p>When done, chill it for a couple hours and then try to not eat the whole goddamned thing in one joy- and <a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/l/louisck452800.html">self-hatred</a>-filled sitting.</p>

  <li><span id="footnote-one"></span>Well, in the category of food that is.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-two"></span>Get key lime juice. Regular limes wonâ€™t work right.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-three"></span>Donâ€™t leave it out. Also, use real butter. Youâ€™re making a pie not a kale and quinoa salad.</li>
