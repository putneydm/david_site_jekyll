I"Ä<p>Marco Arment drew ire â€“ and admiration â€“ for <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground">his blog post</a> arguing that Apple software had lost â€œthe functional high ground.â€</p>

<p>Arment isnâ€™t a typical user â€“ as a developer his view is somewhat more like a mechanic with a car up on a lift â€“ not the person who drives it every day. His view may not be that of a typical user. In addition, he <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/01/05/popular-for-a-day">wrote later</a> that he â€œlooked back at what I wrote with regret, guilt, and embarrassment.â€ But further statements suggest he stands by his central idea that Apple software has not just some rough spots but some strikingly prominent bugs.</p>

<p>My experience with third-party iOS8 keyboards has convinced me he has a point. Iâ€™ve encountered bugs in keyboard implementation in much the same way as Johnny Rico encountered bugs in â€œStarship Troopersâ€. A conversation with a friend who has also had the same problems has convinced me Iâ€™m not an outlier.</p>

<p>Among the problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The keyboard switches back to the iOS default keyboard at random.</li>
  <li>Occasionally no keyboard shows up at all. The only fix is to completely quit the app by swiping up in the application manager.</li>
  <li>Occasionally the keyboard appears turned 90 degrees clockwise and distorted in the top one-half of the app window.</li>
  <li>Itâ€™s easier to install Node.js using the OS X command line than to install an alternate keyboard in iOS 8. It also takes fewer steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly Apple needs to hire Michael Ironside as senior vice president of growling â€œthe only good bug is a dead bug.â€</p>
