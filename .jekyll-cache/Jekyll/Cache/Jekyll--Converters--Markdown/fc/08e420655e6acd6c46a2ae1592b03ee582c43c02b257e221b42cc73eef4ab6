<p>The Boston Globe is lauded – rightfully – for being the first major responsive website.</p>

<p>It won Society of News Design honors. The technological step forward was what made me want to work there as a designer.</p>

<p>That’s why this tweet jumped out at me.</p>

<div style="margin:auto;max-width:498px;margin-bottom:20px;">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Somewhere, under all of these dialog boxes, there is allegedly a <a href="https://twitter.com/BostonGlobe">@BostonGlobe</a> article. <a href="http://t.co/xa2HvLKJh0">pic.twitter.com/xa2HvLKJh0</a></p>&mdash; Waldo Jaquith (@waldojaquith) <a href="https://twitter.com/waldojaquith/status/560423510905217024">January 28, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>He’s right. This page is a total hot mess, and it makes me sad. Is this one of the world’s best designed sites any more?</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> <em>I am <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/01/i-fled-the-news-today-oh-boy.html">former Globe employee</a> and I have many good friends who still work there in the design and development departments. They are talented, hardworking folks who are not responsible for institutional decisions.</em></p>
