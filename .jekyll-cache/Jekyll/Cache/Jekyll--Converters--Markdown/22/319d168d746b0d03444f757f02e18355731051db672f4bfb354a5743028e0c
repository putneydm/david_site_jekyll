I"<p>It’s safe to say that 2014 was not a good year for me.</p>

<p>I got bogged down all summer and most of the fall in a hot mess of project at work. Friends were beset by problems. I spent most of the year depressed and deeply unhappy.</p>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, 2014 can just get the hell out of here and never come back. But, strangely, I wouldn’t take <em>any</em> of 2014 back.</p>

<p>It pushed me in important new directions both personally and professionally. I’m entering 2015 with a feeling that suddenly, unexpectedly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M67E9mpwBpM">everything is coming up Milhouse</a>. I’m enjoying that moment.</p>

<p>Life doesn’t have a third act twist and a happy ending like movies and TV. Nothing I’m dealing with has been solved. But the random miseries of 2014 gave me enough clarity to tackle my bigger problems.</p>

<p>Friends came through for me in a big way. I’m still processing it all. I’m excited and scared.</p>

<p>A better 2015, maybe? Here’s hoping.</p>
