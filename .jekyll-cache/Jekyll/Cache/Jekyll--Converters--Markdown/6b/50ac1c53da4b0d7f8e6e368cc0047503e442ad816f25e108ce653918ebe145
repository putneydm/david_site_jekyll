I"K<p>“She shouldn’t impose her morality on others.”</p>

<p>I’ve heard people say that a lot these days. They are referring to Rowan County, Kentucky clerk <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage.html">Kim Davis</a>.</p>

<p>This view has always struck me as remarkably unself-aware. It’s a statement not an argument. <em>It’s always someone else’s morality.</em></p>

<p>Whether it’s Moses or Hammurabi or a mom setting the rules in the house. Someone is imposing something. Yet, people remain so sure that what they believe is absolutely, uniquely correct when it’s all a product of the accident of their birth.</p>

<p>We like to believe that if everything about our lives was different that we’d still be the same person, that if we were born 100 years ago that we would have been a proto-feminist tossing off our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomers_(clothing)">corsets</a>.</p>

<p>Or if we’d been born to a wealthy family in the Antebellum South that we wouldn’t have kept slaves. Or if we’d been in Germany in the 1940s we’d have hidden Jews in our attic.</p>

<p>Or in the 1950s we’d have been accepting of gay people rather than treating them as deviants.</p>

<p>Truth is we’d have held the same viewpoints as anyone else at the time. After all, you have many of the same viewpoints as people <em>right now</em>.</p>

<p>We are, quite literally, a product of our time and place.</p>

<p>To put it on a shorter timescale, in the 1980s most people thought gays were degenerates. In the 1990s the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_Marriage_Act">Defense of Marriage Act</a> sailed through Congress and was signed by Bill Clinton. In the ’90s sitcoms still made gay jokes<sup><a href="#footnote-morality-one">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>As late as <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/timeline-of-obamas-evolving-on-same-sex-marriage/">2011</a>, Barack Obama was on the record as opposing gay marriage. Just five years ago, a majority of Americans were <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/117328/marriage.aspx">opposed</a> to gay marriage.</p>

<p>Only a handful of people alive right now can claim to have always supported gay marriage let alone claim to have a clean record on gay rights.</p>

<p>Yet we rail at others’ morality, call others bigots, as if our own view was immutable rather than an accident of history and the ebb flow of fashionable belief. For many, morality goes no deeper than “that’s what good people believe.”</p>

<p>Everyone wants to be a good person. It’s a noble goal. It’s deeply ingrained in us from a young age.</p>

<p>So, yes, it is completely accurate that by refusing to issue marriage certificates Davis is imposing <em>her morality</em>. But the Supreme Court, by telling clerks they must issue certificates, is imposing <em>theirs</em>.</p>

<p>Somehow this is something we can only see when our ox is being gored.</p>

<p>An exact reverse of the Kentucky situation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_2004_same-sex_weddings">took place</a> in 2004. Then-mayor of San Francisco Gavin Newsom ordered the city clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in opposition to state law.</p>

<p>He and Davis took/are taking a position that is a fundamental American principle: Civil disobedience against a law they view as unjust. Whether Davis or Newsom is a hero depends on which worldview you agree with. <sup><a href="#footnote-morality-two">2</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s my observation that people only say that “it’s the law of the land. You have to do it” about laws that they agree with.</p>

<p>Likewise, people have no problem imposing morality that they agree with. To be honest, I don’t either.</p>

<p>That’s just how the world works. It’s <em>always</em> someone else’s morality.</p>

  <li><span id="footnote-morality-one"></span><em>Friends,</em> one of the most popular sitcoms of its era, was rife with <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2015/01/22/friends_chandler_bing_and_his_homophobia_are_the_worst_thing_about_watching.html">gay panic jokes</a>.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-morality-two"></span>And like Davis, his advocacy of marriage <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/AIDE-QUITS-AS-NEWSOM-S-AFFAIR-WITH-HIS-WIFE-IS-2652745.php">didn’t extend</a> to his own.</li>
