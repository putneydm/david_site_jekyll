I"æ<p>I think there‚Äôs a whale in that photo somewhere. That black dot. That‚Äôs it.
Frankly, that photo doesn‚Äôt capture the moment well at all. Pretty much <em>none</em> of my photos from a recent vacation do.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs why sitting through someone‚Äôs vacation slides has become shorthand for ‚Äúbored out of your mind‚Äù no matter what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlKs6TknnU8&amp;t=0m55s">Don Draper</a> says.</p>

<p>I was showing my pics to an ‚Äì admittedly game ‚Äì friend the other day on my phone. ‚ÄúWell, this doesn‚Äôt really do it justice,‚Äù I kept saying as I flipped between them. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/">4.7-inch</a> screen just doesn‚Äôt show the scale of a mountaintop <a href="http://www.gohawaii.com/maui/guidebook/topics/haleakala-sunrise">sunrise</a>, a mile above the clouds with a sprawling 12-mile-wide volcanic <a href="http://www.nps.gov/hale/index.htm">crater</a> below.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThat cliff is about 100 feet tall,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, showing a photo of a waterfall that looked more like a backyard koi pond.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAnd those breakers are 25 to 30 feet tall,‚Äù I‚Äôd say, trying to clarify that they may look like ripples but they really are huge waves.</p>

<p>I recently saw a stat that more photos are taken in a month than in the entire first 100 years of photography. About a <a href="http://bgr.com/2013/12/24/how-many-selfies-were-taken-in-2013/">trillion</a> this year. At best photos are poor synecdoche our experiences.</p>

<p>The general unworthiness of photos first hit me a few years ago during what could only be called a once-in-a-lifetime experience for a dorky civilian like me. I was on the deck of the aircraft carrier <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Dwight_D._Eisenhower_%28CVN-69%29">Eisenhower</a> about 10 yards from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonnell_Douglas_F/A-18_Hornet">F/A Hornets</a> blasting off.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs impossible really to fully describe it, the jet fuel smell, the noise, the crew rushing around, the facefull of afterburner blast that could melt paint off a car. And hanging over it all was the feeling that if anything went wrong, chances of survival were somewhere around zero.</p>

<p>I realized I was mainly concerned with getting video. I would never get to experience this <em>exact</em> moment again, so I put my camera away and watched.</p>

<p>I have video of the scene, but as video of carrier takeoffs goes, it‚Äôs not all that good. At max, it proves I was there.</p>

<p>I find myself putting away my camera a lot. Passengers on my <a href="http://www.pacificwhale.org/">whale-watching</a> trip rushed from railing to railing to shoot pics, but I stood on the bow enjoying a warm breeze and tropical blue water while whales repeatedly breached and <a href="http://humpbackwhale.homestead.com/Humpback-Whale-Peduncle-Manouver.html">slapped their tails</a>.</p>

<p>I shot subpar video of the <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g29220-d672529-Reviews-Nakalele_Blowhole-Maui_Hawaii.html">Nakalele Blowhole</a> but I spent most my time watching it explode in a column of spray over and over. Top tip: Stand upwind or you end up with blowhole all over you. That, or bring a <a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/red-sand-beach/">towel</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mauiguidebook.com/adventures/red-sand-beach/">Red Sand Beach</a> in Hana is the most beautiful place I‚Äôve ever seen. The sheer cliffs, the rainforest, the red sand, the natural breakwater. I arrived at the <a href="http://www.photographymad.com/pages/view/the-golden-hour-in-photography">golden hour</a> and it was simply breathtaking. My photos of it are terrible.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt vacation through a viewfinder.</p>

<p>Great moments are here and evaporate. Best to enjoy them and let them go.</p>
