I"ﬁ'<p>A<em>lien</em> may be one of the most influential movies ever made, but the actual plot of the movie could not be more simple.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs the stuff of many a B-grade monster movie. The crew of a space tug <a href="https://propstore.com/the-prop-store-collection/alien/alien-nostromo/"><em>Nostromo</em></a> brings an alien creature on board their ship that proceeds to kill them all. That simplicity is a strength.</p>

<p><em>Alien</em> is so good because of <em>how</em> the story is told. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs such an enduring and timeless <sup><a href="#footnote-one">1</a></sup> masterpiece. The claustrophobic setting, the tension and the groundbreaking production design alone are enough to define it as a classic.</p>

<p>But the creature itself in design and concept is the real reason the movie endures. It‚Äôs disturbing somewhere down in our lizard brain. From its face raping initial appearance to its eyeless-skullfaced remorseless killer adult form, it‚Äôs a nightmare being. In a world of Predators and Terminators and Freddys and Jasons, the Alien xenomorph reigns supreme.</p>

<p>In 1979, <em>Alien</em> was tense and disturbing in a way that few audiences had seen up until then ‚Äì with the exceptions of maybe <em>Jaws</em> or <em>Halloween</em>. But <em>Alien</em> upped the ante by locking its characters in with the murder creature that has a head shaped like a penis just to fuck with the audience‚Äôs psychosexual phobias.</p>

<p>The franchise was revisited in 1986 by a then-up-and-coming James Cameron in <em>Aliens</em>. He kept the claustrophobia but in true sequel fashion ramped up the more! more! more! Unlike the ‚Äúhaunted house in space‚Äù of the first film he went with balls-out war movie ‚Äì <em>Zulu</em> in space. <em>Aliens</em> is one of the greatest <sup><a href="#footnote-two">2</a></sup> action movies ever made and certainly one of the most relentlessly intense.</p>

<p>Sigourney Weaver‚Äôs imposing screen presence is used to great effect, as her Ellen Ripley is not only the best female action hero in screen history, she‚Äôs one of the best ever of any actor. And who could forget the late Bill Paxton as ‚Äúgame over, man‚Äù Pvt. Hudson.</p>

<p><em>Aliens</em> is among the rarest of things: A sequel better <sup><a href="#footnote-three">3</a></sup> than the original.</p>

<p>Some film franchises took awhile to gain speed ‚Äì James Bond, <em>Star Trek</em> ‚Äì but <em>Alien</em> kicked off with two all-time classic movies, seminal films that became a foundation of one of film‚Äôs enduring movie series. Perhaps only <em>Star Wars</em> had this same one-two punch of masterpieces.</p>

<p>How do you follow that? They did‚Äôt.</p>

<p>There has not been a good <em>Alien</em> movie in theaters since 1986. Yet they continue to make them. Worse, the franchise has become just another entry in the ‚Äústupid, annoying people being chased by a monster‚Äù genre.</p>

<p>It isn‚Äôt like they haven‚Äôt tried to make a good movie. The history of the <em>Alien</em> universe is littered with missed opportunities. On paper they sound like the most amazing marriages of subject matter and talent since George Lucas considered Steven Spielberg to <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">direct</a> <em>Return of the Jedi</em>.</p>

<p>Consider these pitches <sup><a href="#footnote-four">4</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>An <em>Alien</em> movie directed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPAloq5MCUA">David Fincher</a>, who you may remember from such films as <em>Seven</em>, <em>Fight Club</em> and <em>Gone Girl</em>. OMG! It‚Äôll be great!</li>
  <li>An <em>Alien</em> movie written by Joss Whedon, a master of melding lightweight pop culture ideas with deep-seated human emotions, horror and action, eg, <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> and <em>Cabin in the Woods</em>. Holy shit! I can‚Äôt wait!</li>
  <li>An <em>Alien</em> movie with franchise originator Ridley Scott returning to the director‚Äôs chair and written by <em>Lost</em> mastermind Damon Lindelof. Mind. Blown.</li>
</ul>

<p>The results are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Alien 3</em>, a long, boring mess that still somehow gave us the most <a href="http://www.vgu.tv/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Alien-3.jpg">iconic image</a> of the entire franchise.</li>
  <li><em>Alien Resurrection</em> a long, boring mess that still somehow gave us this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0GNKQQPHNU&amp;t=1m58s">amazing shot</a> of Sigourney Weaver making an over- her-shoulder three-pointer on the first take.</li>
  <li><em>Prometheus</em> a long boring mess that nonetheless gave us the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneDimensionalThinking">awesome phrase</a> ‚Äúthe <em>Prometheus</em> school of running away from things.‚Äù</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately the foundational idea of <em>Alien</em> isn‚Äôt that complex ‚Äì that simple plot of the first film. There‚Äôs no real Extended Universe of story options. Marvel keeps it fresh by making genre movies with superheroes in them. <em>Iron Man 3</em>‚Äôs buddy cop movie. <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>‚Äôs ‚Äô70s paranoid thriller. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>‚Äôs sci-fi romp.</p>

<p>Every <em>Alien</em> movie is roughly this: Humans stupidly bring the xenomorph on board ‚Äì <em>hey look, it‚Äôs a big scary egg chamber! Let‚Äôs have a closer look!</em> The xenomorph gets loose because the humans underestimate its danger and then it goes around feasting on the humans‚Äô delicious nougaty centers for most of Act Three.</p>

<p><em>Prometheus</em> was this except with black slime.</p>

<aside class="blog-pullquote">
  <blockquote>The body horrors of the Alien spawning cycle are so well known that you can buy a hand knit facehugger to keep your head warm in the winter.

  </aside>

<p>They also continue the tradition of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_body_horror_media">body horrors</a>, to diminishing returns. <em>Alien: Resurrection</em> gives us a room full of malformed Ripley / xenomorph <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEn22-kffi0">clones</a> going ‚Äúk-k-k-kill me. Every moment I‚Äôm alive is agony.‚Äù The baby squid monster<sup><a href="#footnote-five">5</a></sup> extraction of <em>Prometheus</em> is cringey and memorable. But these read like setpieces.</p>

<p>Face it, the xenomorph isn‚Äôt that scary any more. The body horrors of the <em>Alien</em> spawning cycle are so well known that you can buy a <a href="http://geekologie.com/2013/12/staying-warm-a-hand-knit-alien-facehugge.php">hand knit facehugger</a> to keep your head warm in the winter. Or a xenomorph <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kidrobot-TRPHP002-Alien-Xenomorph-Plush/dp/B015NL2CKQ">plushie</a>. Here in Boston there‚Äôs even an <em>Alien: Convenant</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/640928/got_onto_a_alien_covenant_plastered_red_line/">train car</a> with xenomorph pics everywhere.</p>

<p>Thanks to cultural osmosis and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewalker_(The_X-Files)">copying</a>, the alien larvae bursting out of John Hurt‚Äôs chest looking like the universe‚Äôs most toothy and terrifying <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=stiffy">stiffy</a> has a blunted impact at best.</p>

<p>Based on clips of <em>Alien: Covenant</em> we‚Äôre in for a whole new cavalcade of dismemberments a blood squib explosions.</p>

<p>Like the <em>Jurassic Park</em> <a href="https://www.davidputney.com/2015/06/the-problem-with-jurassic-park.html">movies</a>, the <em>Alien</em> series can have whatever first-act setup seems fitting ‚Äì a mix of human stupidity, failure to recognize danger, greed and a dollop of corporate malfeasance so the audience can learn that we were the real monsters all along. But at the end of the day the creatures have to escape and chase everyone around because that‚Äôs what the movies actually are.</p>

<p><em>Prometheus</em> went for ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs it all mean‚Äù grandiosity and wedded <em>At the Mountains of Madness</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Mountains_of_Madness">mythology</a> to the franchise. But it ended up being just a bunch of half-explained Damon Lindeleof mystery box hooey with a group of stupid and annoying humans being chased around for the entire third act. Personally, I was rooting for the aliens.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll probably continue to get <em>Alien</em> movies. We as an audience set expectations of recapturing the visceral fear of <em>Alien</em> or the intense, unrelenting action of the <em>Aliens</em>. Movie studios like nice reliable franchises.</p>

<p>But capturing the greatness of the originals it‚Äôs not possible any more than recapturing a first kiss.</p>

<ol>
  <li><span id="footnote-one"></span>I saw it recently in a one-night theater screening and I have no doubt that it could debut today virtually unchanged ‚Äì perhaps a few special effects tweaks ‚Äì and still be seen as a masterpiece. Or not. It‚Äôs been so copied down the years that critics would condemn it as derivative.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-two"></span>The others are <em>Die Hard</em> and <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-three"></span>The others are <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, <em>Toy Story 2</em>, <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>, <em>From Russia With Love</em>, <em>The Dark Knight</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> and <em>Captain America: The Winter Soldier</em>. There are no others. And yes, I‚Äôm aware of <em>The Godfather II</em> and <em>Terminator 2: Judgement Day</em>.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-four"></span><em>Alien vs. Predator</em> and its execrable sequel are not on this list as they are not canon. I once watched <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> at 6 a.m. while heavily hung over in a Times Square hotel room. Don‚Äôt ask why. The movie was dreadful.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-five"></span>While this is certainly the most effective scene in the movie, it‚Äôs hampered by the fact that the baby squid monster is kinda <a href="http://images.wikia.com/men-in-black/images/e/ef/Squid-baby-SS_01.jpg">cute</a>. Just a little.</li>
