I"õ<p>The sequence showing the Enterprise being destroyed in <em>Star Trek Beyond</em> is a technical marvel.</p>

<p>The techniques that created the vast swarm of ships that suddenly attack, overwhelm and pulverize the iconic vessel is light years beyond the original series. Itâ€™s far beyond the model work used to destroy the Enterprise in <em>Star Trek III</em>.</p>

<p>But when the Enterprise goes down in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M7mM_iHd9I">heroic sacrifice</a> in <em>ST:III</em>, it feels tragic, a lost friend. â€œMy god, Bones, what have I done?â€ Kirk intones as the crew watches horrified as the ship burns up in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><em>Star Trek Beyond</em> isnâ€™t invested in its destruction sequence as anything more than making sure it looks as cool as possible. Considering this is the third Enterprise to bite the dust in a movie, itâ€™s not even a surprise plot development any more. <sup><a href="#footnote-star-trek-beyond-three">1</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Star Trek Beyond</em> just isnâ€™t very good.</p>

<p>By a certain measure itâ€™s perfectly fine. Itâ€™s terrifically cast,  with fast-paced action, sleek sets, state-of-the-art special effects and a fantastic score by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315974/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Michael Giacchino</a>.</p>

<p>Problem is, <em>Star Trek Beyond</em> relies on all of these to get by. Itâ€™s woefully underwritten, with a stock villain â€“ <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0252961/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Idris Elba</a>, unrecognizable and underused as, whatâ€™s his name? <em>Krag? Kris? Krall? Krusty?</em> Who can even remember or be bothered to care? Character arcs, at least for those fortunate enough to get one â€“ Sorry, Sulu â€“ are a more like arrow-straight lines. <sup><a href="#footnote-star-trek-beyond-two">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This is something of a surprise considering how well Simon Pegg, doing double duty here as actor and cowriter, dug into his charactersâ€™ inner lives in his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02LgdXVkXgM">Cornetto trilogy</a>.</p>

<p>But thatâ€™s blockbuster movies these days. Longtime <em>Trek</em> fans whinge about the state of the franchise, but it comes off as a little ungrateful and, frankly, fusty, as so aptly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02LgdXVkXgM">parodied</a> by The Onion.</p>

<p>Before the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0796366/">2009 reboot</a>, the film franchise had been residing happily in the mid-budget tier, a model set by the modestly-budgeted-but-successful <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em>. <sup><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0315974/?ref_=nv_sr_1">3</a></sup> Now, <em>Star Trek</em> needs $200 million to get made and a half billion in box office to break even. Itâ€™s big money.</p>

<p><em>Star Trek Beyond</em> and its two predecessors feel more like giant scale blockbusters because they are. They reduce characters to types â€“ <em>Kirkâ€™s a horndog! Checkovâ€™s Russian!</em> â€“ get the quippy comedy and relationship squabbles right â€“ <em>that Dr. McCoy and Spock sure do bicker a lot!</em> â€“ and even throw in a little world building. Theyâ€™re the shallowest bits people like about <em>Star Trek</em>.</p>

<p><em>Trek</em> originated on TV â€“ â€œradio with picturesâ€ â€“ and it was a show largely about ideas. Episodes such as <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708460/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">The Devil in the Dark</a></em> countered 50â€™s sci-fi monster tropes (The real monster is us!). Or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708455/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>The City in the Edge of Forever</em></a> that dealt with time travel paradoxes in a particularly tragic, cerebral way.</p>

<p><em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> went even deeper into this notion of a show about ideas. <em>Deep Space Nine</em> took it in a far darker, bleaker direction.</p>

<p>Yes, by todayâ€™s standards parts of it are a bit hokey. And the show and films were even completely silly at times. Or in the case of <em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em>, slower than the glaciation of North America while also being completely silly.</p>

<p>Or sometimes completely hopeless, like <em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em>.</p>

<p>Hollywood might not make movies of the type the <em>Star Trek</em> film series used to be, but they do make television of the type <em>Star Trek</em> was â€“ thoughtful, well-written, groundbreaking, experimental.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s why the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqm9HSYbf0o"><em>Star Trek Discovery</em></a> series trailer that premiered alongside <em>Star Trek Beyond</em> at <a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5l4r56LtM1r8yzazo1_500.png">Comic-Con</a> gives such hope. <em>Star Trek</em>â€™s natural home is series television.</p>

<p>The show has two <em>Trek</em> <a href="http://trekcore.com/blog/2016/02/wrath-of-khans-nicholas-meyer-joins-cbss-2017-star-trek-tv-series-writing-staff/">veterans</a> at the helm, a fidelity to deep <em>Trek</em> <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/star-trek-discovery-ship-concept-art/">history</a> and an environment that rewards strong, clear visions. A more human scale, deeper <em>Star Trek</em> seems the likely result.</p>

<p>Then again, itâ€™s CBS who mainly churns out low-grade trash â€“ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKS3MGriZcs"><em>Big Bang Theory</em></a>, anyone? â€“ so maybe not.</p>

  <li><span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-three"></span>The saucer crash sequence in <em>Star Trek Beyond</em> is basically the saucer crash sequence from <em>Star Trek: Generations</em> done with a bigger budget and better tools.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-one"></span>And, note to <em>Star Trek</em> stop using The Beastie Boysâ€™ <em>Sabotage</em>. Itâ€™s a 20-plus year-old song that only old people like me think is cool.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-star-trek-beyond-two"></span> <em>Wrath of Khan</em> was produced by Paramountâ€™s television division. It reused footage from <em>Star Trek: TMP</em>, reused sets and rented equipment and employed other cost-cutting trickery to keep costs down ofter the big-budget failure of the previous movie.</li>
