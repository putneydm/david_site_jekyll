I"m"<p>S <em>tar Wars</em> vs. <em>Star Trek</em>. Which is best?</p>

<p>This is an eternal burning question that cannot be answered, seemingly. Do we even need to? For many a geek, both franchises embody a deep love.</p>

<p>It’s as ubiquitous as East Coast vs. West Coast or Ginger vs. Mary Ann. The debate has even spawned such subdebates as The Enterprise vs. an Imperial Star Destroyer. <sup><a href="#footnote-one-sw-st">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Like that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0539770/">episode</a> of <em>Cheers</em> that argued there’s enough room in this world for fans of <em>The Munsters</em> and <em>The Addams Family</em>, we can always cop out and refuse to make a choice.</p>

<p>One could argue that both are unique in their own way and that fans should just love them both equally. Although anyone with a brother or sister knows “I love you both equally” is a well-intentioned <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-biased-toward-first-child_55a3d771e4b0b8145f730667">lie</a>.</p>

<p>The problem is exacerbated still further by the fact that <em>both franchises</em> are under the control of the same man: JJ Abrams. Allowing two longtime competing sci-fi franchises to become separate visions of a single creator <sup><a href="#footnote-two-sw-st">2</a></sup> makes judging their respective qualities all the harder. We’re really just judging him.</p>

<p>And to be fair, he has led <em>Star Trek</em> into a renaissance – of sorts. It’s hard to argue that the 2009 movie isn’t a decided improvement over previous Trek movies. <sup><a href="#footnote-three-sw-st">3</a></sup></p>

<p>It’s exciting, fast-paced and, more importantly, fun. The film has a sleek and modern production design – the Enterprise bridge looks like an <a href="http://www.buro247.com/images/fifthavenue_gallery_image4.jpg">Apple Store</a>. But those alone don’t make for a good <em>Star Trek</em> movie.</p>

<p>Abrams is an avowed <em>Star Wars</em> fan. In the runup to the <em>Star Trek</em> relaunch he managed to repeatedly enrage fans by stating he <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/movies/bp/j-j-abrams-star-trek-too-philosophical-192548775.html">didn’t like</a> <em>Star Trek</em> and didn’t watch it. So, no surprise that he departed <em>Trek</em> to direct <em>Wars</em>. In his mind it’s a step up. But it seems almost redundant because he also he turned <em>Star Trek</em> into <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>

<p>The plot parallels between <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>A New Hope</em> are uncanny, beyond the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth">hero’s journey</a> employed as a character arc in any movie with epic aspirations. It wasn’t just the orphaned farm boy going to space or the planet-killing bad guy or making a stop on a very Hoth-like planet. Abram’s reboot was much more in the fast-paced, episodic action-adventure vein of <em>Star Wars</em>.</p>

<p>It loses some essential Trekiness. The best scene in of all the movies – of any <em>Trek</em> for that matter – is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCpYqWAIwFA">initial showdown</a> between Capt, Kirk and the eponymous villain in <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.</em> Sure, it involves some <em>pew pew pew</em> lasers, but what makes it great is that it’s all about Capt. Kirk outthinking his enemy.</p>

<p>By comparison both <em>Star Trek</em> reboot movies feel like the film equivalent of a cover version of a song. They only exist because of the original.</p>

<p>Considering this, the upcoming <em>The Force Awakens</em> is much less of a mystery. If we had to guess what it is going to be like, we’d go with “a lot like the 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> reboot.” That’s actually the movie he’s been longing to make, it’ll just be <em>Star Wars</em> this time.</p>

<p>But even as the two franchises drift toward one another, the eternal question of which is better, <em>Trek</em> or <em>Wars</em>, is in a way quantifiable.</p>

<p>If one were to take all the various incarnations of <em>Trek</em> – the movies, the five TV series, the animated series – and rank them against the whole of <em>Star Wars</em> – the six movies, the two Ewok TV movies, the animated movie and TV show, the holiday special – which percentage-wise would have the most bad.</p>

<p>For beloved franchises, both have a wealth of embarrassingly bad moments. At the outset we’ll concede that by sheer volume of bad, <em>Trek</em> wins easily because there’s so much more of it. But by percentage – that gets dicey.</p>

<p>One might quickly jump to <em>The Star Wars Holiday Special,</em> which is canon because it introduces Chewbacca’s home planet of <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Kashyyyk">Kashyyyk</a> and Boba Fett. Surely nothing in Trekdom is as bad as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CRTow8hFvM&amp;t=2m16s">cooing</a> Diane Carroll providing virtual reality spank material for Chewbacca’s grandfather Itchy.</p>

<p>But then we have Spock <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OptLgGtZ9_E">jamming</a> on his Vulcan harp with space hippies in <em>TOS</em> episode <em>Journey to Eden</em>. For every “I don’t like sand” line from <em>Star Wars</em> there’s a “Brain? Brain? What is brain?”</p>

<p>The <em>Star Wars</em> prequels get lots of <a href="http://peoplevsgeorge.com/">fan hate</a> – justifiably so. Entire swaths of the Star Trek canon may not sink quite as low, but they certainly suffered from creative exhaustion. Later seasons of <em>Voyager</em> and most of <em>Enterprise</em> are a grim slog indeed.</p>

<p>In any mathematical quantifying of the franchises, <em>Star Trek</em> would probably lose to <em>Star Wars</em> on the overall quality front. But it would be close. In either case, there’s certainly more bad than good in both franchises.</p>

<p>But quality issues aside, the needs of Hollywood blockbusters mean that we aren’t going to get the same types of movies or TV shows that made us fans in the first place. In this regard <em>Star Wars</em> faces a greater degree of difficulty.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars</em> is something people fall in love with in their childhood. As a result, we love it irrationally.</p>

<p>A colleague one said he didn’t see <em>A New Hope</em> until he was in his 40s. When asked what he thought of it, he paused and said “Well, the dialogue is really bad.” He’s not wrong, but fans are willing to overlook this and revel in childhood joy. <em>Star Trek</em>, by being present culturally through multiple incarnations, at least had a chance to grow up along side its fans.</p>

<p><em>The Force Awakens</em> is freighted with expectations, expectations it can’t meet. The deep love of childhood nostalgia attached to <em>Star Wars</em> means that no movie – not even <em>Star Wars</em> itself – is good enough to be the idealized movie we carry around in our heads.</p>

<p>An attempt to create that idealized movie is about to be repeated over and over - a <em>Star Wars</em> <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/11/building-the-star-wars-universe/">cinematic universe</a>. Whether  <em>Star Wars</em> can become an open-ended series and retain its special place in our culture remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Regardless of all the “what does it mean,” <em>Star Wars</em> fans are sure to break box office records and flock to the movie. It doesn’t actually matter if it’s good or not. But let’s hope it is.</p>

<p>Whether one franchise is better than the other is probably at this point is irrelevant because the only perfect realization of either series exists in our own head. Any filmmaker can only guess and try to get it right.</p>

  <li><span id="footnote-two-sw-st"></span>Ronald D. Moore’s stewardship of <em>Star Trek</em> and <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> shows this can work, even if <em>BSG</em> felt like Moore finally getting to do what he wanted with <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and <em>Voyager’s</em> overall themes.</li>
