I"c<p>Twenty-five years ago right around the time I write this I was sitting in my first college class.</p>

<p>Turns out, it was a key moment of my life.</p>

<p>It’s not often that something like this can be so easily pegged to a particular date. In this case I can recall it because bluesman Stevie Ray Vaughn had died the night before.</p>

<p>A quote from Vaughn was written across the blackboard of my Journalism 121 class. The professor, a blues fan, was especially hit. “Awful,” he said to the class. “And right after he’d cleaned up.”</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>

<p>The untimely death of someone so young and so long ago feels like a beacon laid down in the past, a reminder of how much time has passed and how much has been lost.</p>

<p>I think back to me as a young pup in class and difference between the aspirations of what I wanted then. Am I where I thought I’d be?</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure why I chose journalism as a major even as it shaped most of my life. I think I may have said something about “Hey, I can write” when I ticked the box on my college forms. Regardless, I was now sitting in a journalism class.</p>

<p>It was taught by an affable, shaggy professor with a room-filling laugh. He both walked and talked 100 hundred miles per hour and was usually seen with a disorganized stack of papers and trailed by a string of students like baby ducks struggling to keep pace.</p>

<p>His oft-repeated journalism mantra: “If your mother tells you she loves you, check it out.” Good advice for any profession.</p>

<p>We, of course, got in an argument almost immediately. During his class intro about journalism being the search for truth, he began polling the class: “Tell me something that’s true.”</p>

<p>“Truth is relative,” snot-nosed me said assuredly. We argued about whether his shirt was yellow or not, with him taking the “Of course it is” argument.<sup><a href="#twenty-one">1</a></sup></p>

<p>We’ve disagreed a lot through the years – I lost a pitcher of beer bet to him over the ‘92 elections – he was an important mentor and friend.</p>

<p>What became clear quite quickly was that 21-year-old me really wanted  to become a reporter.</p>

<p>After years of aimlessness - I’d been a janitor, carpenter, warehouse worker, layabout –  I finally had a goal. I set out quite intently on it. Yet, aside from working my student paper and some internships, I never did become a reporter.</p>

<p>I did work in news. Looking back, it would even seem that I had a carefully executed plan. But not really. I just did stuff.</p>

<p>I ended up as a co-founder of a daily newspaper without really setting out to be one. I co-founded and launched several websites. I ended up at a top-tier newspaper.</p>

<p>Not bad for someone who failed to meet his goal.</p>

<p>Earlier this year I broke with the news industry and set out on a new path. It’s not at all the career that 21-year-old me expected to find himself in. It’s all new and daunting and exciting.</p>

<p>I look at the timeline that stretches out behind me and think about the one ahead, I realize that they are both about the same length – 25 years. <sup><a href="#twenty-two">2</a></sup></p>

<p>I’m back at that college desk, pretty much. Looking for a change, making a fresh start and learning as much as possible. Embarking.</p>

<p>As I write this, I am on a ferry to Provincetown, Mass. I just stood out on the deck and watched Boston recede into a dot that disappeared over the horizon.</p>

<p>That’s how I feel. The place I began is just out of sight, in the distance. Another place is ahead. I’m somewhere in between.</p>

  <li><span id="twenty-one"></span>For the record, I remain correct about this. Color is relative and based on language. Primitive languages – even Greek and Latin – did not have words for colors. Even modern languages assign different meanings. Russian doesn’t have a word for pink. It’s just light red. Russians can “see” shades of blue Americans cannot because of language used to talk about shades of blue.</li>
