I"ë<p>Politics is such a hideous word. It uglifies everything, witness â€œ<a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_85.htm">office politics</a>.â€</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the dirty, smelly public <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJrWlHRT-18">restroom</a> of our shared experience. We need it, but nobody really wants to go in there. Well, normal people, at least.</p>

<p>But we live with politics like a rash that just wonâ€™t clear up. Maybe thatâ€™s because political messaging actually works. At least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election">51 percent</a> of the electorate thinks so every four years.</p>

<p>For some candidates, politics are natural, like breathing â€“ Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan come to mind. With Hillary Clinton, she may as well be reading her political message aloud off notecards.</p>

<p>Look, here she is <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/who-reported-hillarys-historic-chipotle-visit-and-how-322940">waiting in line</a> at a Chipotle! And now sheâ€™s <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3042625/Hillary-ditches-Scooby-flies-New-Jersey-wrapping-three-day-Iowa-campaign-tour-totes-luggage.html">flying commercial</a> and carrying her own luggage! And now sheâ€™s talking to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3040482/Campaign-staff-DROVE-ordinary-Iowans-Hillary-s-campaign-stop-including-health-care-lobbyist-training-Obama-campaign-intern-Biden-chauffeur.html">average Iowans</a> in a coffee shop!</p>

<p>See how relatable she is! Sheâ€™s just like you. At least for the next week or so until she moves on to the next message.</p>

<p>Never mind that waiting in line or carrying our own luggage are things all of us do every day without even thinking about it, but for Hillary, theyâ€™re unusual enough to be newsworthy. Thatâ€™s why they come off as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCvQ_7u1XeI">awkward</a> as a first date with me.</p>

<p>The security footage looks more like sheâ€™s robbing the Chipotle than picking up lunch there. Her so-called <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/04/14/21/2792C07900000578-3038778-image-a-17_1429044109115.jpg">Scooby Van</a> looks like something youâ€™d use to cart Darth Vader around.</p>

<p>These stunts are aimed at covering her weaknesses, but to anyone paying attention, the messaging actually exposes them. They wouldnâ€™t be going to such lengths to show Hillary being just plain folks if she had been doing that effortlessly all along.</p>

<p>After several days of watching Hillary go after the presidency like an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmDXVbte5Oc"><em>Alien</em></a> facehugger, maybe all I can think about is politics. But the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise is undergoing some populist Hillary-level political messaging and reinvention this week, albeit a little more deftly.</p>

<p>Like Hillaryâ€™s campaign(s), the <em>Star Wars</em> prequels came with excellent, popular pedigree, were well-financed and were guaranteed a certain level of success even without really even trying.</p>

<p>But, toward that end, Hillary and the prequels â€“ which would be a good band name, come to think of it â€“ had/have a certain â€œgoing through the motionsâ€ vibe about them.</p>

<p>I recall actually being relieved when the end credits for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a2COOvciqc">â€œReturn of the Sithâ€</a> rolled. That feeling of â€œIâ€™ll never have to sit through another terrible <em>Star Wars</em> movie.â€</p>

<p>The implicit and explicit message of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCc2v7izk8w">new trailer</a> is that the <em>Star Wars</em> you love is back. X-Wings skimming over a lake! The Millennium Falcon dodging TIE Fighters! Explosions! Storm Troopers! Lightsabers!</p>

<p>The line â€œChewie, weâ€™re home,â€ â€“ a tad sentimental, perhaps â€“ reads on several levels.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s notable about the prequels is how un-<em>â€œStar Wars</em>-like they were. The prequels were about politics and cities and offices and talking and talking and talking â€“ people on the inside, literally and figuratively.</p>

<p>The first trilogy was about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_joDNOpeWWo">people on the outside</a>. The movies took place on the fringes â€“ out-of-the-way planets, secret bases, in exile on a swamp planet.</p>

<p>George Lucas even famously cribbed his Old West imagery for the â€œLuke returns to the burning homesteadâ€ scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uj-XZ0OJrXQ">â€œThe Searchers,â€</a> perhaps the definitive movie about finding and building a home â€“ or failing to â€“ on the frontier.</p>

<p>Judging from the new trailer, this new <em>Star Wars</em> gets this. It couldnâ€™t be clearer that this is a new <em>Star Wars.</em> The prequels are drifting away with the <a href="http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/dvd/ep5/avenger2.jpg">rest of the garbage</a>.</p>

<p>And, like Hillary, the Disney folks are going out of their way to drive their message home.</p>

<p>Considering the brutal <em>SNL</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXdNYXMQoy8">cold open</a> last week, Hillary has a long way to go. Considering the number of folks jizzing themselves over the latest teaser trailer, the Disney folks are nailing it.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars</em> is home.</p>
