I"2<p>About 15 years ago a group of us were gathered around a computer waiting for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo5PYJvAAMI">“The Phantom Menace”</a> trailer to download.</p>

<p>It was still early enough in Internet time that an online debut was a problem. The combination of a big movie file and huge demand led to a giant trainwreck. It took hours to download even on our company’s fast internet.</p>

<p>The trailer had 10 million downloads, which I seem to recall was the most <a href="http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/star-wars/241666/how-the-phantom-menace-teaser-trailer-became-a-cinematic-event">popular download</a> of its time, though it’s likely been surpassed since.</p>

<p>Within seconds of <a href="http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/lucasfilm/starwarstheforceawakens/">“The Force Awakens”</a> trailer popping up, thousands, if not millions had seen it and were already <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22The%20Force%20Awakens%22&amp;src=tren">tweeting</a> about it.</p>

<p>How times changed. One thing to remember is that in 1998, “The Phantom Menace” trailer looked awesome. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo5PYJvAAMI">Go watch it.</a> It’s got some Jar Jar, sure, but face it, but there’s nothing to suggest it would be terrible. Good trailers mean nothing, case in point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc2EgLp_nyg">one</a>, and case in point <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYQoKXDrSlM">two</a>.</p>

<p>My response to the Millennium Falcon and the “Star Wars” theme is almost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning">pavlovian</a>, so it’s hard to make a rational assessment of any “Star Wars” trailer.</p>

<p>Rather, the implicit message of “The Force Awakens” trailer seems to be a sort of relationship counseling. “We know you’ve been hurt in the past. It’s OK to love again.”</p>

<p>MG Siegler seems to have hit the nail on the head with this <a href="https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/538352930580357121">tweet</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pretty sure that teaser is already better than any of the last three Star Wars films.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The trailer has left me giddy, sure. But …</p>

<p>I posit “The Star Wars Problem”. Most people fell in love with “Star Wars” as children. We love it completely and irrationally, so irrationally that <em>no movie</em> including “Star Wars” itself could ever meet expectations.</p>

<p>What I want is that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKRIUiyF0N4">moment</a> in a theater when the lights go down, a “long time ago…” appears to silence followed by a blare of of horns, the “Star Wars” logo and the iconic theme music and crawl. <em>“It is a period of civil war …”</em></p>

<p>It’s a moment of pure transcendent transporting joy back into the comfort of childhood that no movie can possibly equal it.</p>

<p>Whatever comes after that moment just needs to be “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxKtZmQgxrI">not terrible</a>.”  Guess we’ll know for sure in about a year.</p>
