I"á!<p>Could god ever make a stone so heavy that even he could not move it?</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a thought exercise taken from Judaism. It‚Äôs meant to consider the nature and reach of power. Perhaps a better question is <em>why</em> would god want to make a stone so heavy that he could not move it.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs a notion the struck me not in the light of a holy place but in light of the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/22/11092028/apple-tim-cook-fbi-encryption-internal-memo">FBI vs. Apple</a>. If I might belabor my metaphor a bit longer, Apple wishes to be the author of the limits on its own power. It wants to make a stone so large that it cannot move it.</p>

<p>That alone makes for an unusual situation.</p>

<p>But this issue is not just an unusual situation, it‚Äôs a political one too. While reasonable people can disagree on politics, they seemingly can‚Äôt disagree on politics <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/02/25/melissa-click-fired-by-university-missouri.html">reasonably</a>. Not when the argument folds in corporate power, government reach, privacy, technology, right vs. left, law enforcement and Islamic terror.</p>

<p>It‚Äôd be safer to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement at Thanksgiving than to discuss Apple v. FBI.</p>

<p>¬†</p>

<p><strong>I‚Äôve been trying</strong> to strip all of the ideological cruft away as much as possible and come up with a workable analogy for what‚Äôs going on.</p>

<p>Imagine if, instead of FBI v. Apple, the case was FBI v. Apple Safe and Strongbox Works and that investigators were seeking help in opening a safe full of papers.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact the case would barely make headlines outside of safe-industry trade publications, the whole situation suddenly seems much less fraught. The claims that helping the FBI would affect all safe owners and put a chilling effect over the whole safemaking industry might seem like a stretch.</p>

<p>In fairness, it‚Äôs at this point that my safe analogy falls apart. A phone is hackable from anywhere in the world in a way a safe is not. They are a trove of personal information.</p>

<p>While my cynical nature makes me think that ‚Äúprivacy advocates‚Äù<sup><a href="#footnote-one-fbi-apple">1</a></sup> mainly object to anything that would be successful at catching criminals,<sup><a href="#footnote-two-fbi-apple">2</a></sup> they are correct here on the merits.</p>

<p>Building security into computers is a task of a different magnitude than securing a strongbox. Any company that sells <a href="http://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/">device security</a> as a feature can‚Äôt put a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port, no matter if it is ray-shielded. Someone is eventually going to find out about it and put a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WBG2rJZGW8&amp;t=13m19s">torpedo</a> into it.</p>

<p>Software makers can‚Äôt half-ass security. They need their whole ass in the game.</p>

<p>Even so, Apple‚Äôs reaction, considered in other contexts, still seems a tad overwrought if it was about just privacy. Tim Cook <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/ceo-tim-cook-defends-apples-resistance-fbi-iphone-37226344">declared</a> it a ‚Äúcancer‚Äù on the software industry and the company‚Äôs <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-encryption-lawsuit-idUSKCN0VY2PI">legal brief</a> said it was the equivalent of requiring a drug company to make lethal injection drugs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope">slippery slope</a> fallacy has been getting quite a workout because of this legal battle. Additionally, when Apple argues ‚Äúno reasonable person‚Äù they may as well just say ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman">No true Scotsman ‚Ä¶</a> ‚Äú Any issue argued using several logical fallacies is at least suspect.</p>

<p>And the slope can slide both ways. What if Apple was a gun manufacturer refusing to help investigators track a gun owner?</p>

<p>¬†</p>

<p><strong>Daring Fireball‚Äôs John Gruber</strong> argued that this case was carefully chosen to get headlines and to sway public opinion on the matter.</p>

<p>So what? That doesn‚Äôt change the essential question of the case or what it would mean in a very real way to people affected by it. And <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_motive">attacking motives</a> is a logical fallacy right alongside slippery slopes.</p>

<p>Most people will probably look at this case and see the world‚Äôs wealthiest and most powerful company refusing to help an investigation.</p>

<p>While it‚Äôs entirely fair to disagree with this view, the people who espouse it are not wrong. Whatever policy or precedent emerges from this fight <em>will</em> have real-world implications in many directions.</p>

<p>We can play the abstraction game and talk about it in high-minded terms of freedom and privacy, but the reality means telling dozens of grieving people that, no, we aren‚Äôt going to help investigate. That goes for other cases affected by this, both large and small.</p>

<p>This is a message that‚Äôs far easier to deliver by <a href="http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/">press release</a> and legal brief. It‚Äôs much harder to tell someone that in person. Certain types of crimes will be harder to stop or investigate going forward.</p>

  </aside>

<p>Fights over rights aren‚Äôt neat academic abstractions. It‚Äôs why questions like these are so difficult. It‚Äôs telling someone that what I want is more important than what they want. Regardless of who wins, the process is still two tigers and an antelope voting on what to eat for dinner.</p>

<p>Pretending it‚Äôs otherwise is fundamentally dishonest.</p>

<p>¬†</p>

<p><strong>Something about this</strong> case just bugs me.</p>

<p>Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an insufferable pedant. I‚Äôm the guy at the party who after someone‚Äôs story says ‚ÄúBut actually ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú</p>

<p>Apple has framed this as a matter of privacy and chilling effects on software developers and the like. And, yes, privacy is an important issue here. <em>But actually ‚Ä¶</em></p>

<p>This privacy talk is mainly for public consumption, as a way of trying to get the public to align its interests with Apple‚Äôs. This isn‚Äôt cynicism per se. Apple does believe in privacy beyond marketing<sup><a href="#footnote-three-fbi-apple">4</a></sup>. But privacy for you and me isn‚Äôt the actual reason Apple is going to the mat over this.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs no question whether the FBI has a right to access the info ‚Äì it‚Äôs a phone owned by <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/02/19/apple-fbi-san-bernadino-iphone/#PGQq8YqU6PqK">government entity</a> and is evidence in a crime. The case is about the means by which the FBI accesses it. And for Apple the method the FBI is seeking is a liability issue.</p>

<p>Apple wants disputes over recovering contents of a phone to be between the phone owner and law enforcement. When earlier versions of iOS allowed easier cracking, Apple complied with court orders to unlock phones. It doesn‚Äôt want to do that any more.</p>

<p>And it certainly doesn‚Äôt want to be asked to do that in countries that aren‚Äôt so hot on the whole human rights thing, such as China.</p>

<p>The only way to do this is for Apple to build a phone operating system that even they themselves cannot crack ‚Äì God‚Äôs own unmovable stone. It becomes not their problem any more.</p>

<p>And that is the precedent Apple hopes to establish.</p>
