I"Î<p>BDCwire was conceived as a way of bringing the energy and speed of a startup to a large news organization. It was a site aimed at college-age and young-professional readers around Boston. It had more freedom in its topics, with a focus is music, movies, pop culture ephemera and local events.</p>

<p>I designed the entirety of the site over a four-month period, and it was launched in the fall of 2013. My design is lively and spare with large, bold images and simple typography.</p>

<p>BDCwire is configured as a quick-scan reverse-chron blog. Itâ€™s was to have a more distinctive voice and be more personality-driven than news sites, so author avatars were featured prominently sitewide.</p>

<p>Readers donâ€™t come into sites through the front page any more. BDCwire pages were designed to give readers multiple entry points to other destinations on the site â€” the events calendar, story teasers and a full blog entry roll with endless scroll on every page.</p>
