I"I<p>I’ve never been warned that I would die so many times in a single week.</p>

<p>Here’s the text of a typical warning sign I saw during a trip to Maui.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Warning</strong>
Stay Clear of Blowhole.
You can be sucked in and killed.
It’s Not a WaterPark.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case it was hand-scrawled on a weathered green piece of plywood up the hill from the <a href="http://tours-maui.com/Rotors/hana/HanaWaterfall.jpg">Nakalele Blowhole</a>. To get to the blowhole, visitors clamber over boulders the size of a car, down a path made slick and muddy by the light rain that was falling, along the edge of a cliff to finally view the geyser-like sight.</p>

<p>If that’s not enough of a death sport, visitors could walk right up to the blowhole and stick their head into it. If they wanted to, you know, die.</p>

<p>That’s pretty much how most of the amazing sites on the island are: Hard to find, and once you get there, potentially lethal. Want to tour a <a href="http://www.mauicave.com/">lava tube</a>? Pay $12, get a flashlight and then the guide points toward a hole in the ground.</p>

<p>Want to see a spectacular <a href="http://tours-maui.com/Rotors/hana/HanaWaterfall.jpg">waterfall</a>? Climb down a slippery, homemade ladder, across boulders the size of a sofa, cling to a muddy path along the stream and then stumble and bumble 50 yards down a streambed filled with slimy, round rocks.</p>

<p>It’s a marked change from the swaddling over-security of Boston, where they seem to make up dangers just some they can pass laws against them. Warning: The cranberry nut muffins might contain nuts.</p>

<p>If Maui was somehow relocated to Boston, the blowhole would have a ramp, an elevator, walkways, canopies, lighting, signage and railings. No one would be allowed to approach it until listening to a safety lecture and donning protective gear.</p>

<p>Warning: Seawater in the blowhole may contain salt. Those on a low-sodium diet are advised to stand upwind.</p>

<p>Things that make life safer make nature worse. And the whole point is enjoying nature.</p>
