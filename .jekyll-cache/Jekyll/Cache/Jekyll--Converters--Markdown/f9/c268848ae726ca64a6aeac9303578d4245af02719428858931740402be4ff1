I"<p>I was 8-years-old and in the second grade in 1976, the Bicentennial Year for the United States. The small town I lived in had an essay contest with the subject “What America Means to Me.”</p>

<p>My fiercely jingoistic writing<sup><a href="#footnote-essay-contest">1</a></sup> won second place, which was a silver dollar, and I got to read my essay in front of the town council. My mom saved it and gave it to me a few years ago.</p>

<p>Here’s that essay:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>America is a loving union on earth and beautiful. Im glad christopher columbus found it. With people helping each other and sharing and working together. Its a country of freedom its great because everybody it taking care of people helping them grow. the end David Putney</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Have a happy and fun July Fourth weekend.</p>
