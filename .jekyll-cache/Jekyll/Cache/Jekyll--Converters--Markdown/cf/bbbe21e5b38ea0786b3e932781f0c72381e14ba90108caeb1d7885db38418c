I"‰<p>It is said that Thomas Jefferson was such an inveterate tinker that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GGK1XO0jVEoC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;dq=monticello+disrepair&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Dsq8kj-KcJ&amp;sig=dcqx68jTHmW8DkwboCHbZ13Wr6c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Gb-3VIatDYLksATJ6YDYDQ&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=monticello%20disrepair&amp;f=false">Monticello</a> was in a simultaneous state of being built while falling down.</p>

<p>Likewise this site.</p>

<p>Davidputney.com been in a continual state of repair and renovation since launch. (Iâ€™m sure you all noticed the new data-URI/local storage <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/01/uris-mine-and-hours.html">font loader.</a>) My latest change, is a bit more public.</p>

<p>I swapped out the sans serif font <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/montserrat">Montserrat</a> with another sans, <a href="http://www.hypefortype.com/browse-fonts/font-categories/headline/ginger.html">Ginger</a>. Itâ€™s a font Iâ€™d seen some time ago, but was reminded of it by one of my <a href="https://twitter.com/elainanatario">former colleagues</a>.</p>

<p>Ginger and Montserrat are both geometric fonts, but Monserrat has a bit of a modern edge. Ginger has an <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/">Avant Garde-ish</a> mid-20th Century feel, as if it should be in a Don Draper advertising campaign.</p>

<p>Ginger has a smaller <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height">x-height</a>, â€“ generally I donâ€™t like fonts with small x-heights â€“ so I had to do some further tweaking to get the scaling right. And by â€œrightâ€ I mean Iâ€™ll change it six more times this week.</p>

<p>Donâ€™t worry, though. I did some cache busting to make sure it loads properly. If you donâ€™t see the new font, Iâ€™ll gladly refund your money.</p>

<p>But, setting aesthetics aside, the addition of Ginger puts Davidputney.comÂ® strongly â€œon brandâ€ vis-a-vis my <a href="http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/redhead-photo-sperm-bank-invitro/?_r=0">hair color</a> and lack of ability to tan. And thatâ€™s what we do these days anyway, is build our personal brand on FaceTweet.</p>
