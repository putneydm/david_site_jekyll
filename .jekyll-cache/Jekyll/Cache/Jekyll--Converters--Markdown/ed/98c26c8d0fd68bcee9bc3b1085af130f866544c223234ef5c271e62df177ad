I"è<p>If Christopher Nolanâ€™s movies are anything they are grounded.</p>

<p>His breakthrough <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><em>Memento</em></a> is a time travel movie with no actual time travel. His <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Batman</a> trilogy stripped away Tim Burtonâ€™s gothic operatics to create bleeding, bruised Caped Crusader confronting a terrorist siege.</p>

<p>And <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571/?ref_=nv_sr_1"><em>The Prestige</em></a> â€“ which I call â€œBatman vs. Wolverine, With Magicâ€ â€“ doesnâ€™t contain magic or mysticism, just stagecraft, misdirection and technology.</p>

<p>Nolanâ€™s literalism has led some critics to ding his movies for lacking â€œpoetry,â€ and rightly so. Still, the Batman trilogy remains intriguing and unique, in part, because Nolan seemingly had to understand the superhero in literal terms to make a movie about him.</p>

<p>Nolanâ€™s literalism also gives him a tendency toward flat-footed and overly expository dialogue. His movies always come with a clearly voiced thesis statements, such as <em>The Dark Knight</em>â€™s â€œYou either die a hero or you live long enough to become the villainâ€ or the wonderfully <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=some+men+just+want+to+watch+the+world+burn+meme&amp;revid=687253791">memeable</a> â€œSome men just want to watch the world burnâ€</p>

<p>Matthew McConaughey growls â€œWe used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.â€ That seems a usable enough premise for a great sci-fi movie.</p>

<p><em>Interstellar</em> certainly seemed promising, if not downright thrilling in its potential. Filmâ€™s grounded literalist was basically getting <em>all the money</em> and making a space movie. After Nolanâ€™s successes, he could clearly do what he wanted.</p>

<p>Top theoretical physicists were consulted to make sure the special effects were <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/10/astrophysics-interstellar-black-hole/">scientifically accurate</a>, not just pretty. And they are both. The <a href="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ut_interstellarOpener_f.png">black hole</a> Gargantua makes for a looming, silent cinematic presence while being so accurate that a scientific paper was written about discoveries made during its creation.</p>

<p>Everything suggested the movie would be a literal look at manâ€™s expansion into space. Who couldnâ€™t watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WzHXI5HizQ">teaser</a> with its highlight reel of spaceflight achievements and not get excited. Or, less promisingly, be reminded of the <em>Star Trek: Enterprise</em> opening <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55LC7H8aT6M">credits</a>.</p>

<p>Turns out, however, <em>Interstellar</em> ended up with a competing thesis statement, found in Anne Hathawayâ€™s â€œ<a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/11/love-in-sci-fi-interstellar-speech">love</a> is the most powerful force in natureâ€ soliloquy.</p>

<p>Physics, meet metaphysics. Again.</p>

<p>Science fiction <a href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2014">dominates</a> movies, but hard sci-fi is a rare treat. We get, what, one or two per decade? Yet the mark of â€œseriousâ€ sci-fi is to wander off into religious allegory, with some scene of the protagonist floating around in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX7VNiBoXQY&amp;t=35m28s">glowey white</a> space heaven as orchestral music swells.</p>

<p>You find that theme in most serious, ambitious sci-fi movies. <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> works quite well as Christian allegory. Mankind is awakened to his potential by an unseen higher power who eventually helps Dave Bowman throw off physical constraints and concerns as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLZdnR7Nkus">transcendent being</a>.</p>

<p><em>Contact</em> â€“ whose bravura <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwhQB3TKXA">opening shot</a> weds science and cinematic wonder for one of the most beautiful sequences in all of sci-fi â€“ uses science to transport Ellie Arroway <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scBY3cVyeyA">across the galaxy</a>. But only faith allows her to accept alien visitation in the form of her beloved father in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmtc0n7iSNU">tropical alien afterlife</a>.</p>

<p>In <em>Gravity,</em> broadcasting â€œin the clearâ€ is a form of prayer that give Ryan Stone strength to achieve physical survival and spiritual renewal.</p>

<p>When <em>Star Trek</em> went the big-ideas route in the ill-fated <em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</em> the producers hired <em>2001</em>â€™s Douglas Trumbull for the special effects and sent the crew off on a search for <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/V%27ger">God</a> and meaning. The crew met God again in <em>Star Trek V</em> but it turned out less well for God as he failed to meet Shatnerâ€™s standards and was killed.</p>

<p><em>Interstellar</em> has its own big-ideas religious themes to unpack. The more obvious is the Christ analogy of McConaugheyâ€™s Cooper leaving earth with a promise to return and save humanity from destruction. A black hole serves as a celestial Pearly Gates that instead of horribly  killing Cooper, it sends him into the Space Library of Congress to create the movieâ€™s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_paradox">bootstrap paradox</a>.</p>

<p>Or maybe higher beings save him. Or super-advanced humans. Itâ€™s confusing that way.</p>

<p>Including all this religiosity doesnâ€™t necessarily make for a bad sci-fi story.</p>

<p>These movies are just the stories we like to create and to tell and the ideas we grapple with. Most people know that <a href="http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/11/love-in-sci-fi-interstellar-speech">Joseph Campbell</a> formulated the idea of cross-cultural themes after George Lucas popularized the idea with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F7Wwew8X4Y"><em>Star Wars.</em></a></p>

<p>Lucas was savvy enough to throw in some quasi-religon sorcererâ€™s ways into â€œStar Warsâ€ to keep things mythic.</p>

<p>But religious allegory has become the go-to sci-fi story. Coldly atheistic <em>Alien</em> was transubstantiated into a quest to find our creator in the muddled <em>Prometheus</em>, presumedly so the story could be â€œmore meaningful.â€</p>

<p>Humans are tiny and fragile compared with the scale and brutality of the universe, a theme <em>Interstellar</em> handles well. The human reaction to our smallness is to conjure up gods with the power to control whatâ€™s beyond our grasp.</p>

<p>Creating distant benevolent entity playing to our better natures and saving humanity with technology indistinguishable from magic is just inventing God out of science and reason.</p>

<p>Like so many in sci-fi, Nolan seemed unwilling to send his characters out into a godless and barren universe filled with discovery, fact and reason, toward the kind of movie he seemed so suited to make.</p>
