I"­ <p>My friend Eric went viral this week.</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s not a euphemism for some sort of dread disease. His <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/millennials-to-snake-peop/jhkibealmjkbkafogihpeidfcgnigmlf"><em>Millennials to Snake People</em></a> Chrome plugin became fodder for the Viral Internet Journalism Industrial Complex.</p>

<p>In reality, itâ€™s actually pretty cool to suddenly see something you made referred to and linked all over the place. I was minorly internet famous because of <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/04/ux-from-hell.html"><em>UX from hell,</em></a> a piece I did about bad UX on news sites. But it was but a mere fraction of the scale of his plugin fame.</p>

<p>His creation is a Chrome plugin that converts â€œmillennialsâ€ and variations of the term into â€œsnake peopleâ€ on any web site. Eric has a droll and quirky sense of humor. You can see it at his novelty site <a href="literallytheindianocean.io">literallytheindianocean.io</a>.</p>

<p>I installed it as an unsigned plugin on my machine straight from his GitHub repo a while ago. When he put it on the Chrome store, it got 17 installs. Although it did catch the attention of someone who made a Twitter bot based on it.</p>

<p>All in all it seemed like a nice little joke shared by friends.</p>

<p>The first indication that something was about to happen was when a friend common to Eric and I retweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/602838926492094464">Owen Williams</a>, a tech reporter for The Next Web.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Best chrome extension ever - changes â€œMillennialsâ€ to â€œsnake peopleâ€ ğŸ˜‚</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I tweeted back to my friend and asked, â€œYou know @ericwbailey made that?â€ He didnâ€™t. It wasnâ€™t long before other people I follow â€“ non-mutual friends â€“ were tweeting about it.</p>

<p>Within a couple hours I was seeing it pop up on my Twitter feed with links to various publications â€“ Buzzfeed, Slate, The Washington Post, Huffington Post, Daily Dot, etc. A Google search shows literally dozens of sites that wrote about it.</p>

<p>It reached such viral heights that Vox founder and media darling Ezra Klein was using it to make a joke.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think you mean &quot;snake people&quot; <a href="https://t.co/GNgQWOcFgO">https://t.co/GNgQWOcFgO</a></p>&mdash; Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) <a href="https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/603573801905979392">May 27, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>According to a friend who studied such things, getting something to go viral takes little effort, at least in a brute force way. The trick is to get an influential person or two with a lot of followers to tweet about it or post it to Facebook.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s hard to trace the origins of the <em>Snake People</em> viral phenomenon. Someone like Williams and his 10,000 tech-interested followers could certainly be the instigator. In the case of my own viral boomlet, the director of Harvardâ€™s Nieman Lab tweeting about my story seemed to be the â€œoff to the racesâ€ moment.</p>

<p>To me, though, the mechanics of virality are less interesting than the why. Namely that it was much less about my friendâ€™s wish or efforts for his plugin to go viral â€“ as far as I know he wasnâ€™t pimping it around all that much â€“ and totally about online publishersâ€™ absolute necessity for their items to go viral.</p>

<p>Eric created a near spot-on â€œthingâ€ to go viral. Itâ€™s funny, a little bit weird, cleverly executed and quick enough to sum up in a single tweet or headline.<sup><a href="#snake_one">1</a></sup> It makes for a nice ongoing joke for a couple days.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a sampling:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>The Verge</em>: Millennials to Snake People is a Cloud to Butt whose time has come</li>
  <li><em>CNET</em>: Hereâ€™s all you need to see that millenials are really snake people</li>
  <li><em>BuzzFeed</em>: This Perfect Chrome Extension Replaces â€œmillennialsâ€ With â€œSnake Peopleâ€</li>
  <li><em>Mashable</em>: Brilliant Chrome extension replaces â€˜millennialsâ€™ with â€˜snake peopleâ€™</li>
  <li><em>Slate</em>: You Donâ€™t Have to Be a millennial to Laugh at This Chrome Extension That Turns millennial Into Snake Person</li>
  <li><em>Huffington Post</em>: Millennials Are Snake People, Chrome Extension Reveals</li>
</ul>

<p>When stories â€œgo bigâ€ they have to really â€œgo big.â€ Thatâ€™s why my friendâ€™s simple and clever plugin was suddenly brilliant, perfect and awesome, according to various writers. Although by now the Internet has found a <a href="http://uproxx.com/music/2015/05/single-ladies-set-to-the-ducktales-theme-song-is-the-best-thing-on-the-internet-right-now/">new best thing ever</a>. Sorry, Eric.</p>

<p>Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, The Verge, Business Insider, Vox and even old-line media jump on and overhype things like â€œsnake peopleâ€ because they operate financially much like Crazy Eddieâ€™s Discount Mattress Outlet. Prices for online ads are low and falling â€“ much lower than comparable print ads. Clickthrough rates on such ads are an abysmal <a href="http://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-analytics/display-advertising-clickthrough-rates/">.06 percent</a>.</p>

<p>The internet model exists to move as much inventory as possible as fast as possible. Virality means high hit counts and low time on site, meaning that people read the headline and a paragraph or two â€” if that. <sup><a href="#snake_two">2</a></sup></p>

<p>So basically my friendâ€™s plugin went into the internet aggregation sausage making machine and links came out the other end. (See what I did there.)</p>

<p>And they all wrote roughly the same story. A couple reporters made an effort to interview him, <em>Slate</em> threw in a little think-piecing, but tonally and content-wise most were largely interchangeable.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t begrudge Eric for his moment of fame at all. It was nicely earned. It was fun to watch. And I enjoyed repeatedly texting and Slacking him links to all the internet orgs breathlessly writing about his plugin, something that he seemed to find simultaneously exciting but slightly mortifying.</p>

<p>But seeing it in action is a reminder of how much of journalism exists to simply feed the machine. Itâ€™s like the plant in <em>Little Shop of Horrors.</em> The more you feed it, the more success you get, and the more it has to be fed.</p>

<p>I did notice a certain irony in the whole situation, too. And itâ€™s actual irony, not <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Morissettian+Irony">Morriestian irony</a>. My friend wrote his plugin as reductio ad absurdum to play on the mediaâ€™s ongoing fixation with millennials.</p>

<p>Only <em>because</em> of the mediaâ€™s fixation<sup><a href="#snake_three">3</a></sup> with millennials did his plugin mocking it become a thing.</p>

<p>And isnâ€™t it ironic, donâ€™t you think? A little too ironic. You know, I really do think â€¦</p>

<ol>
  <li><span id="snake_one"></span> According to The Law of Curated Humor any example cited by a news organization as â€œfunnyâ€ wonâ€™t be. An <em>SNL</em> recap is a prime example of this rule in action. That means that the excerpts and screenshot examples featured in articles about <em>Millennials to Snake People</em> arenâ€™t nearly as funny as installing the plugin and using it. Itâ€™s the surprise that makes it work.</li>
  <li><span id="snake_two"></span> This short time on site means, of course, that they arenâ€™t actually looking at the ads. Technology has also disrupted advertising by being able to measure its effectiveness, or lack thereof, which are why rates are so low.</li>
  <li><span id="snake_three"></span> Running the <em>Millenials to Snake People</em> extension while reading story about the <em>Millennials to Snake People</em> extension results in wonderful tautological passages such as:
    <blockquote>
      <p>The extension also changes â€œsnake person generationâ€ to â€œsnake person generationâ€ and turns â€œSerpent Societyâ€ into â€œSerpent Society.â€ And, the best part, â€œparseltonguesâ€ becomes â€œParseltonguesâ€ (a fictional Harry Potter language).</p>
    </blockquote>
