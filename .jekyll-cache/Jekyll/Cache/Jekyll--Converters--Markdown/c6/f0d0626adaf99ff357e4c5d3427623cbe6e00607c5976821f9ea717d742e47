<p>Thereâ€™s something end-times Roman Empire about <em>Mad Max: Fury Road.</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s not a new idea that the decadence of the Romansâ€™ entertainments said as much about the people who enjoyed them as it did about the entertainments themselves. <em>Fury Road</em> is the kind of over-the-top orgy of blood and violence and inhumanity and mayhem that an ancient Roman can only dream about.</p>

<p>Times may change, but people donâ€™t.</p>

<p>Read as commentary, <em>Fury Road</em> is all our excesses â€“ love of violence, celebrity culture, braggadocio, flaunting vulgarity â€“ drawn out to a logical conclusion. The dystopian world of <em>Mad Max</em> combines the brutality of ISIS throwing gays off a building as a crowd cheers with the â€œhey, look-at-meâ€ vulgarity of the Kardashians.</p>

<p>The villainâ€™s skull face mask and motorcycle-sprocket codpiece are as much his personal brand as his costume. Itâ€™s not a stretch to think of Donald Trump, freed of his last constraints of good taste, dubbing himself Rictus Erectus and riding around in a Mercedes E-class mounted on a monster truck chassis.</p>

<p>I suspect the production designers and people who came up with the cars had an absolute blast making this movie. One can imagine the production meetings:</p>

<p><em>â€œWhat if the attack force were led by a giant truck with rows of taiko drummers and a mutated guy playing power chords in front of a towering stack of amps?â€</em></p>

<p><em>â€œI doubt audiences would like that. So, we also need to also make the guitar a flame thrower to be sure.â€</em></p>

<p><em>High fives.</em></p>

<p>Humanity seems to be constantly at war between its good and evil natures. If history â€“ or current events, actually â€“ is any indication, evil nature wins as often as good.</p>

<p>One of the movieâ€™s memorable moments comes when Nux, a young, naive War Boy â€“  his head filled with dreams of glory, barreling across the desert, surrounded by carnage â€“ plunges into an apocalyptic sandstorm shouting â€œOh, what a day. What a lovely day!â€</p>

<p>Exiting the theater, I overheard someone comment that Nux symbolized a Taliban fighter. Possibly, but I think heâ€™s us at our very worst, heedlessly storming ahead into the unknown and danger, reveling in the spectacle of it all and not caring what it means.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not a stretch to say a culture that lines up for iPhones or Air Jordans would, if driven to the brink, kill for food.</p>

<p>â€œMad Maxâ€ walks a fine line. It shows our worst cultural excesses while reveling in them in beautiful, poetic, glorious fashion. All while wearing a shit-eating grin.</p>

<p>And I loved it. What a movie.</p>
