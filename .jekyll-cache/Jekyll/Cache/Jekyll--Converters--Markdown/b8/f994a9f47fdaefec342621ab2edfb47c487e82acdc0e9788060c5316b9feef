I"]<p>Winter creates a magic moment every time it snows. The world falls silent. The landscape is transformed by a blanket of white. The mundane and grimy is suddenly covered in sparkles and beauty.</p>

<p>Spring and summer rarely see that type of sudden transformation. You can feel it perhaps in the golden hour or just after a summer shower. But you don’t get the feeling of entering a different, magical world.</p>

<p>Except for one special day.</p>

<p>Boston had a terrible long, – <a href="http://www.davidputney.com/2015/02/frozen.html">seemingly endless</a> – winter. Even last week jackets and coats were the norm. The mercury said it should be warm, but a stiff, chilly wind made sure temps were cold enough to be not <em>actually</em> warm.</p>

<p>Yesterday the weather turned, and with it gray of winter has suddenly been swept away. For several days I could tell that everything was just about to bloom. Trees were budding and bits of green could be seen, building-up energy and about to burst forth.</p>

<p>Today was that magical day when the line was crossed and stark, barren winter is finally gone. Leaves on the trees, flowers blooming everywhere – it has that same world-transformed feel of a winter snowfall, but awash in color and life.</p>

<p>Today was that special day. That first true spring day. It’s my favorite day of the year.</p>
