I"¬<p>We are taught from a young age by movies and TV to divide the world into good guys and bad guys and to vociferously boo the villains.</p>

<p>More importantly, we are taught that they are easy to identify. To help matters along, directors find it a lot easier to use off-the-shelf visual cues and simplistic morality to stack the deck. <sup><a href="#davis_note_one">1</a></sup></p>

<p>When Darth Vader <a href="http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/AA5-photo_6.jpg">steps through</a> the door of the blockade runner at the beginning of â€œStar Wars,â€ heâ€™s a faceless, menacing presence in a Nazi SS helmet and cape. The blaring minor key horns on the soundtrack drive the point home.</p>

<p>Most movies do this to some degree or another. They are so effective at it that sometimes audiences get the good guys and bad guys mixed up. For the record, Walter White was actually the <em>villain</em> of <em>Breaking Bad.</em></p>

<p>â€œYes, but itâ€™s just movies and TV,â€ you might say. â€œItâ€™s not real life.â€</p>

<p>Yet, even without realizing it, much of how we understand the world comes straight from movies and TV. All most people know of aerial combat or the Titanic sinking or space travel or what goes on in a hospital operating room or how police work is handled comes <em>solely</em> from TV and movies.</p>

<p>Entertainment leaves us with an impression of how the world works, but itâ€™s wholly skewed. Fighter jets donâ€™t work like in <em>Top Gun</em>, and â€œbad guysâ€ arenâ€™t like we think they are either.</p>

<p>Namely, every villain is the hero of his own story. <sup><a href="#davis_note_two">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Our culture and our nature doesnâ€™t make this easy for us to understand or to live. We most often judge others by their actions but ourselves by our motivations.</p>

<p>â€œThat asshole just cut me off in traffic. Can you believe it?â€ we shout. But a couple days later we are saying to ourselves â€œI can slip into this line ahead of everyone because Iâ€™m late for an appointment. Itâ€™s OK.â€</p>

<p>Sometimes <em>you</em> are actually the asshole. Sometimes everyone is. Which brings me to what I really wanted to write about: Kim Davis.</p>

<p>The Rowan County, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/04/us/kim-davis-same-sex-marriage.html">Kentucky clerk</a> was recently jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Sheâ€™s wrong, but somehow much of the hatred spilling her way feels wronger.</p>

<p>The scorn, slut-shaming, misogyny, slurs and, yes, bigotry aimed toward her this week is shameful. Sheâ€™s treated like an inbred, stumped-toothed hillbilly. People have made fun of the way she looks, the way she dresses, her personal life, etc.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s always been my understanding that stereotypes and personal attacks are bad. But my discomfort isnâ€™t just that.</p>

<p>Something about the whole gay marriage aftermath in general isnâ€™t sitting right with me. It took me a while to finally put my finger on it.</p>

<p>After the gay marriage ruling a couple months back, I saw a lot of people celebrating â€“ people who had paid no price for the victory, people who just a few years before had been opposed to the whole idea, people who a few years before that were were telling gay jokes.<sup><a href="#davis_note_three">3</a></sup> Or <a href="https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/639502513142669312">politicians</a> who just a few years before <em>ran for president</em> opposed to it. <sup><a href="#davis_note_four">4</a></sup></p>

<p>It wasnâ€™t their victory.</p>

<p>But this hasnâ€™t stopped the Johnny-come-latelies from engaging in sudden, Puritanical righteousness on the issue. Thereâ€™s a decided in-your-face tone of â€œnow we can really stick it to people who opposed it.â€</p>

<p>Davis is wrong in her stance, as many other people once were. But her position isnâ€™t fashionable righteousness. She is willing to go to jail for what she believes in a way that people making their Facebook avatars rainbow colored never were or would be.</p>

<p>Nor can we presume to understand Davisâ€™s heart. Growing up, I knew racist people. I know some now. They are far more complex than any stereotype might suggest. Iâ€™ve seen people who used racial slurs in casual conversation who also treat individual black folks with compassion and friendship.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve known many Christians who were far more generous, selfless, giving and humble than the people screaming at them that they are bigots. Iâ€™ve also known some who were worse, to be sure.</p>

<p>In the movies the hero is always righteous in his quest and the villain is always evil, like Hans Gruber trying to drag John McClaneâ€™s wife out the window even after heâ€™s lost.</p>

<p>Life generally doesnâ€™t work that way.</p>

<p>Davis needs her mind and heart genuinely changed. Iâ€™m not sure calling her a hateful bigot does that. Iâ€™m not even sure itâ€™s an accurate label. I certainly donâ€™t like the pitchforks and torches mentality.</p>

<p>The world doesnâ€™t need more hate. It needs more empathy. A lot more.</p>

<ol>
  <li><span id="davis_note_one"></span>The simplest way to make a character sympathetic â€“ or, inversely, unsympathetic â€“ is to do a single scene demonstrating even the smallest of imbalance of power between the two characters.</li>
  <li><span id="davis_note_two"></span>Yes, there are real, unredeemable villains in the world â€“ Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, etc. Most workaday people are not.</li>
  <li><span id="davis_note_three"></span> Or in some cases just a few days before.</li>
  <li><span id="davis_note_four"></span>Dick Cheney, the bette noir of liberals, came out in favor of gay marriage long before Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.</li>
</ol>
