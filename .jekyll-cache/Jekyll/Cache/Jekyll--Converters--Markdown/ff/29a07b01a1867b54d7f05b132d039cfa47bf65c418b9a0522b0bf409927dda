I"¡<p>This week, some asshole picked my MacBook up off a table at a Starbucks and walked out the door with it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d stepped outside to take a call â€“ not a smart move in retrospect â€“ but I didnâ€™t want to be that guy shouting into a cell phone. As I was standing in the doorway talking on my phone, whoever stole my computer probably walked right past me.</p>

<p>Logic suggests this would be a high-risk crime.</p>

<p>The shop was crowded â€“ packed even â€“ with dozens of customers. All it would take would be one person saying â€œHey, wait a minute â€¦â€</p>

<p>The store has several cameras monitoring both front doors, so the crime and the criminal were sure to be caught on video. He had to have known that.</p>

<p>In addition, my computer was running Find My Mac, which would immediately ping me if the machine was connected to the Internet and show me its location on a map.</p>

<p>Despite all this, what has happened since has given me a sinking feeling that the computer will never be found again.</p>

<p>This is how we imagine we will be if a crime is ever perpetrated against us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long IT career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my laptop go now, thatâ€™ll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you. But if you donâ€™t, I will look for you, I will find you, and I will kill you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As much as Iâ€™d like to run around punching members of an international laptop-stealing ring in the throat like Liam Neeson, I really just sat down at my table and wondered if I was going to be fired.</p>

<p>I texted my friend</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>um, so my work laptop was just stolen.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What?!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™m so screwed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was/is a $2,500 machine, only a month old, which is how long Iâ€™d been at my job. It was a job that I loved. I hoped theyâ€™d understand.</p>

<p>I was now going to be â€œthat guyâ€ the one they told stories about after getting drunk at the office Christmas party. â€œRemember that guy we hired and then like three weeks later he let his new laptop get stolen â€¦ â€œ</p>

<p>I called 911, and the dispatcher told me to come down to the station and fill out a report. I told her I had two witnesses and video, so could she send an officer? She said one would be by, but she didnâ€™t know when.</p>

<p>â€œAn hour? Two hours? Tonight?â€ I asked.</p>

<p>â€œOne will be by sometime.â€</p>

<p>The officer who did show up was a jovial fellow who told me a hilarious story about a hooker trying to pick him up when he was on plainclothes patrol. He also told me that he could only take a report.</p>

<p>Only a detective can view the video and interview witnesses, he explained. â€œItâ€™s a union thing. In other states police can investigate, but in Boston it has to be a detective.â€</p>

<p>Iâ€™d pictured a valiant cop showing up and tracking the perp through the freshly fallen snow and and then sweating a confession out of him. â€œYouâ€™re going up the river,â€ heâ€™d say, before muttering, â€œFilthy criminal.â€</p>

<p>Clearly this wasnâ€™t going to happen. He gave me a case number and left.</p>

<p>A detective has yet to call me. My case likely landed on his desk with a few dozen others that day. The laptop is worth enough that it is felony theft, but itâ€™s still not important enough to be treated as a priority. Or even hardly at all.</p>

<p>What would seem to be a risky crime with solid evidence against the perpetrator is in reality a fairly safe one.</p>

<p>My employers took the theft in stride. Theyâ€™re filing an insurance claim and Iâ€™m taking some ribbing. Iâ€™ve set up Find My Mac to ping me if it should be connected to the Internet. But thereâ€™s something deeply angering just picturing some guy doing what he did and getting away with it. Or even thinking he got away with it for a few days.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m still hopeful. The officer said they enjoy pulling up to peopleâ€™s houses, knocking on the door and asking â€œWhere did you get that laptop?â€</p>

<p>And then throat-punch them like Liam Neeson.</p>
