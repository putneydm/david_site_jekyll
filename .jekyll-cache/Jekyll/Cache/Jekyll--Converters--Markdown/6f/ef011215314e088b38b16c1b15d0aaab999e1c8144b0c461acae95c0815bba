I"¥<p>The breakout movie of the summer was â€¦ actually it wasnâ€™t a movie. It was TV, some internet show. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> to be exact. And the breakout character of <em>Stranger Things</em> was â€¦ not the person anyone expected.</p>

<p>It was the frumpy, bookish best friend of suburban princess <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0544729/">Nancy Wheeler</a>. In a time of steroidal superheroes and TV anti-heroes, Barb pushed her way to the front of the 2016 pop culture pack in her unfashionable librarian glasses, blouses made out of grandmaâ€™s curtains and <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=obama+mom+jeans&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwic7ryXifTOAhWEmx4KHZ-GDgEQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=803">mom jeans</a>.</p>

<p>There is just something compelling about her. She isnâ€™t just uncool. Sheâ€™s tragically uncool.</p>

<p>In some ways her appeal is due the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yS9d6Z7nZJM">Boba Fett</a> effect. The villainous bounty hunter has but a few lines, mostly stands around and dies ineptly. Yet heâ€™s seen by fans as the alpha bad-ass of galactic history. Less is more. Mysteriousness adds to appeal.</p>

<p>Many of <em>Stranger Things</em> characters are types generously <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html">borrowed</a> from horror, Steven Spielberg movies or, in the case of the teen characters, John Hughes movies. Among the group of preternaturally precocious preteens, we have the the doubter, the dork, the skeptic and the believer.</p>

<p>Wynona Ryder, stealing scenes instead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unyKRYb7WPo">clothes</a> from Saks,<sup><a href="#footnote-one-stranger">1</a></sup> is desperate and assured, a foil to the burned-out, morally flexible sheriff, haunted by his own child he failed to save.</p>

<aside class="blog-pullquote">
  <blockquote>If Steve is the spoiled rich kid that we loath yet envy, Barb is the uncool kid that we fear becoming, yet sympathize with.
</blockquote>
  </aside>

<p>Barb is a type also, but she is something more. If Steve is the spoiled rich kid that we loath yet envy, Barb is the uncool kid that we fear becoming, yet sympathize with.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s possible to look at her extreme <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=normcore&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL1rHfivTOAhUJpR4KHSykAvAQ_AUICCgB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=803">normcore</a> style admiringly and go, <em>yeah, what a bad-ass, she owns that shit!</em> Itâ€™s more that sheâ€™s just an extreme fashion disaster beyond any kind of help. Sheâ€™s herself, but that self isnâ€™t anything anyone wants.</p>

<p>She ends up at Steveâ€™s beer and teen sex party because she is Nancyâ€™s driver <sup><a href="#footnote-two-stranger">2</a></sup> and cover story. Sheâ€™d never be there on her own merits. Too uncool. While the other kids are pairing off, sheâ€™s left to go home alone. Again.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s the blood from her hand â€“ stabbed while trying to <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Shotgun-a-Beer">shotgun</a> a beer <sup><a href="#footnote-three-stranger">3</a></sup> like a frat boy â€“ that attracts the monster, not the fornicating teens, in a nice twist on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCtbDlNuNUY">trope</a> of laid-then-slayed in horror movies.</p>

<p>And, poor Barb, even in death sheâ€™s neglected, written off as a runaway not worth even searching for. Ignored in life, used and then thrown away. Thatâ€™s Barb. Who hasnâ€™t felt like her at one time or another?</p>

<p>This is why <em>Stranger Things</em> creators the Duffer Brothers <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-season-2-justice-for-barb-creators-duffer-brothers-promise-netflix/">promised</a> â€œjustice for Barbâ€ in Season Two. In a way, it will be justice for all of us.</p>

<ol>
  <li><span id="footnote-one-stranger"></span>Yes, this is a cheap shot.</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-two-stranger"></span>Letâ€™s talk about her car. Itâ€™s a Volkswagen Cabriolet, possibly the coolest car a teenage girl could have at that time. Itâ€™s also a Mark II, which was not sold until 1988. Perhaps Barb is a Time Lord?</li>
  <li><span id="footnote-three-stranger"></span>The symbolic link between Barbâ€™s stabbed and bleeding hand and Nancyâ€™s first time should have even the dimmest fan on metaphor alert.</li>
</ol>
