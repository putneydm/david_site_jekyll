I"<p>We’re live. Finally. It still has that new website smell.</p>

<p>I’ve been working on a new Davidputney.com pretty regularly since early October. It’s not so much done as kicked out the door. Please be patient as I still clean up some of the messes that I made.</p>

<p>This replaces <a href="http://mosthorriblethingever.com/davidputney/">an older</a> jQuery-based site that I built over a three-day weekend because I needed a portfolio site to apply for a job. This redesign is about the fourth guise for a domain that I’ve owned for 14 years now, probably to the dismay of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=david+putney&amp;es_sm=91&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CTNeVNC4KMXOsQSqzYLQCw&amp;ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1164&amp;bih=641&amp;dpr=2.2#imgdii=_">other David Putneys</a> who have would like to have it.</p>

<p>Building this was also an interesting exploration for me. I have an upcoming post on some of the technology and philosophy that went into it.</p>

<p>Until then, welcome.</p>
