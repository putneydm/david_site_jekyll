I"R<p>I’ve been to several design conferences in the past couple years, and typically within the first few hours some sort of <a href="http://seen.co/event/artifact-conf-east-2014-biltmore-hotel-providence-united-states-2014-8044/highlight/31526">discussion</a> will break out – usually on Twitter – over “should designers code”.</p>

<p>A lot of pixels and a some vitriol have been also <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=designers%20should%20code">spilled</a> on the subject. But it’s really nothing but a <a href="http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/bunfight">bunfight</a>. Opinions get tossed around but no one actually gets hurt.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://twitter.com/putneydm/status/516602892997103616">position</a> has always been <em>of course</em> designers should code. Why would you not? It’s the fundamental technology of the web.</p>

<p>But “designers should code” sounds a little <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/bossypants-tina-fey/1100058573?ean=9780316056892">bossypants</a>. I’m not sure I like that.</p>

<p>After all, it’s not a necessity to do the job. Whatever genius drew the bite-the-back-of-your-hand <a href="http://drivecarreviews.com/aston-martin-dbs-vs-db9-and-vanquish-hq-top-gear-series-10-bbc/">beautiful</a> lines of an <a href="http://www.astonmartin.com/en-us/cars/the-new-vanquish">Aston Martin</a> probably doesn’t know how to design a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_injection">fuel injection system</a>.</p>

<p>Coding and building have always been a natural fit for me. I’ve been studying both computers and design since I was teen. In high school I programmed an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II_series">Apple II</a> to to draw an endless array of swirling colored lines. It felt like magic then and years later coding a website still feels a little like magic.</p>

<p>But a lot of designers didn’t follow my path into the industry. They were painting and drawing and studying graphic design while I was pecking away at a keyboard.</p>

<p>Their art-before-science approach has value. So I’d like to make a more nuanced case for designers learning to code.</p>

<p>Web “design” is all in how you define it, like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">tale</a> of the elephant and the blind men. The argument is whether a designer should understand the parts or the whole.</p>

<p>A visitor to this or any other site sees the images and color and typography choices, aesthetics – designer stuff, the parts. But they’re seeing the whole thing. They’re seeing your data structure, your site architecture.</p>

<p>They’re seeing the HTML/CSS/jQuery – the equivalent to a building’s <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/09/21/article-2206050-0059AA091000044C-332_964x756.jpg">structural steel</a>. They’re seeing that your site is lightweight and <a href="http://bit.ly/1vjITLx">fast</a> when it loads seemingly instantly. They’re seeing that the code and the structural parts have <a href="http://frenchseams.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Millau_Bridge_France-fog.jpg">real beauty</a> in how they support the overall need.</p>

<p>There’s joy in how the most mundane parts of a thing are made. When <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJx6cF-H__I">Jonny Ive</a> talks about the design of a unibody Macbook he’s as enthusiastic over the process and the functionality itself as much as beauty of the final object.</p>

<p>That’s how designers should think about their work.</p>

<p>Greatness comes from the entire object. And the only way to understand a thing is to <em>make</em> it, to get your hand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW8j818w-qE">hands in the dirt</a>.</p>

<p>This is design. And it’s in the code as much as the final product.</p>
