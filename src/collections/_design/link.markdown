project: "Link was a legacy-media project to capture the attention of a group of readers who had rejected traditional newspapers. It was not just color and photos and pop culture. It was a full-on reinvention of the form that news took that proved to be years ahead of its time. I was a cofounder who saw the project into production and guided it to success."

## How might we ...
* Reach an audience alienated by traditional newspapers
* Bring some color, fun and innovation to a stodgy and cautious business
* Capture advertisers who might not otherwise be interested in or afford newspaper advertising. 
* Generate passionate readers, not just eyeballs, but fans -- loyalists.

## Unique Challenges 
### No. 1 | Starting a print publication from scratch

Newspapers are complicated to make. They are essentially a manufactured product that is made on a daily basis. Among them:
* Building library items and templates in the the front-end production system
* End-to-end testing of the production to printing process
* Print-run prototyping
* Finding, interviewing and hiring a talented and diverse staff, who all had to relocate
* Setting up an office
* Establishing a routine, ramping up staff and hitting a daily deadline

### No. 2 | Reaching a difficult-to-reach demographic

**Understand the market** 

So we did something that newspapers rarely if ever did: Talk to people and listen to their input.  We did extensive research -- type that might be considered normal these days -- into what the target market was into. We did a competitive survey -- but not of newspapers. We looked at magazines, websites and alternative sources. 

**Prototype and iterate**  

We did multiple prototypes, including one that was printed on a large format printer glued together with a glue stick and held together with binder clips for user testing. What we found was that the *user experience* of newspapers -- headline, photo, story written in the most boring way possible -- was fundamentally flawed with this group. The readers we wanted didn't want that. 

**Target content** 

We found that readers actually wanted:
* Brevity
* Lists
* Facts
* Color
* Imagery
* Data Visualizations
* Integration of photo, copy and design

### No. 3 | Creating a fresh brand in an industry damaged by decades of stasis

In the news business, *your content is your brand.* So Link needed to emphatically not be what had come before.

The core Link group did a brand exercise, and landed on several keywords. Among them: "genuine," "lively" and "active." Being cool wasn't our aim. We didn't want to be [Poochie the Dog][1]. *Editorial voice* was far more key to success than design alone. We focused on *how* it spoke as well as what it spoke about. Link was:

* Conversational -- Written in normal language and not "newspaper speak."
* Excited -- Tell stories we are *excited* to share with readers. If we can't be excited about them, how can readers?
* Explain, don't tell -- Stories were informed by the key parameters of what happened, what it means and what's next.
* Active stories -- Readers should be able to not just read, but go and do  -- concerts, crafts, get-togethers, etc.
* Solve problems for readers -- Life-hack type stories would take precedence, such has health, home, cooking and lifestyle.

### No. 4 | Setting a world-class standard with a limited staff

Link was meant to be small and scrappy -- just 8-10 people -- but with large ambitions as a design-forward organization. As such, we had to do much with a small staff. 
* Versatile staff -- designers wrote and writers designed, not to squeeze out more work but to let people's creativity go where it led them.
* Design days -- everyone got a day off daily pages to work on a longer-term, more complex project.
* Ownership -- people could pitch it, design it and see it go to print
