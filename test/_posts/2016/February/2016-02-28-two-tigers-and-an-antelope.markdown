Could god ever make a stone so heavy that even he could not move it?

It's a thought exercise taken from Judaism. It's meant to consider the nature and reach of power. Perhaps a better question is *why* would god want to make a stone so heavy that he could not move it.

It's a notion the struck me not in the light of a holy place but in light of the [FBI vs. Apple][4]. If I might belabor my metaphor a bit longer, Apple wishes to be the author of the limits on its own power. It wants to make a stone so large that it cannot move it.

That alone makes for an unusual situation.

But this issue is not just an unusual situation, it's a political one too. While reasonable people can disagree on politics, they seemingly can't disagree on politics [reasonably][5]. Not when the argument folds in corporate power, government reach, privacy, technology, right vs. left, law enforcement and Islamic terror.

It'd be safer to discuss the Black Lives Matter movement at Thanksgiving than to discuss Apple v. FBI.

&nbsp;

**I've been trying** to strip all of the ideological cruft away as much as possible and come up with a workable analogy for what's going on.

Imagine if, instead of FBI v. Apple, the case was FBI v. Apple Safe and Strongbox Works and that investigators were seeking help in opening a safe full of papers.

Aside from the fact the case would barely make headlines outside of safe-industry trade publications, the whole situation suddenly seems much less fraught. The claims that helping the FBI would affect all safe owners and put a chilling effect over the whole safemaking industry might seem like a stretch.

In fairness, it's at this point that my safe analogy falls apart. A phone is hackable from anywhere in the world in a way a safe is not. They are a trove of personal information.

While my cynical nature makes me think that "privacy advocates"<sup>[1][1]</sup> mainly object to anything that would be successful at catching criminals,<sup>[2][2]</sup> they are correct here on the merits.

Building security into computers is a task of a different magnitude than securing a strongbox. Any company that sells [device security][6] as a feature can't put a small thermal exhaust port right below the main port, no matter if it is ray-shielded. Someone is eventually going to find out about it and put a [torpedo][7] into it.

Software makers can't half-ass security. They need their whole ass in the game.

Even so, Apple's reaction, considered in other contexts, still seems a tad overwrought if it was about just privacy. Tim Cook [declared][8] it a "cancer" on the software industry and the company's [legal brief][9] said it was the equivalent of requiring a drug company to make lethal injection drugs.

The [slippery slope][10] fallacy has been getting quite a workout because of this legal battle. Additionally, when Apple argues "no reasonable person" they may as well just say "[No true Scotsman ...][11] " Any issue argued using several logical fallacies is at least suspect.

And the slope can slide both ways. What if Apple was a gun manufacturer refusing to help investigators track a gun owner?

&nbsp;

**Daring Fireball's John Gruber** argued that this case was carefully chosen to get headlines and to sway public opinion on the matter.

So what? That doesn't change the essential question of the case or what it would mean in a very real way to people affected by it. And [attacking motives][12] is a logical fallacy right alongside slippery slopes.

Most people will probably look at this case and see the world's wealthiest and most powerful company refusing to help an investigation.

While it's entirely fair to disagree with this view, the people who espouse it are not wrong. Whatever policy or precedent emerges from this fight *will* have real-world implications in many directions.

We can play the abstraction game and talk about it in high-minded terms of freedom and privacy, but the reality means telling dozens of grieving people that, no, we aren't going to help investigate. That goes for other cases affected by this, both large and small.

This is a message that's far easier to deliver by [press release][14] and legal brief. It's much harder to tell someone that in person. Certain types of crimes will be harder to stop or investigate going forward.

Fights over rights aren't neat academic abstractions. It's why questions like these are so difficult. It's telling someone that what I want is more important than what they want. Regardless of who wins, the process is still two tigers and an antelope voting on what to eat for dinner.

Pretending it's otherwise is fundamentally dishonest.

&nbsp;

**Something about this** case just bugs me.

Perhaps it's because I'm an insufferable pedant. I'm the guy at the party who after someone's story says "But actually ... "

Apple has framed this as a matter of privacy and chilling effects on software developers and the like. And, yes, privacy is an important issue here. *But actually ...*

This privacy talk is mainly for public consumption, as a way of trying to get the public to align its interests with Apple's. This isn't cynicism per se. Apple does believe in privacy beyond marketing<sup>[4][3]</sup>. But privacy for you and me isn't the actual reason Apple is going to the mat over this.

There's no question whether the FBI has a right to access the info -- it's a phone owned by [government entity][15] and is evidence in a crime. The case is about the means by which the FBI accesses it. And for Apple the method the FBI is seeking is a liability issue.

Apple wants disputes over recovering contents of a phone to be between the phone owner and law enforcement. When earlier versions of iOS allowed easier cracking, Apple complied with court orders to unlock phones. It doesn't want to do that any more.

And it certainly doesn't want to be asked to do that in countries that aren't so hot on the whole human rights thing, such as China.

The only way to do this is for Apple to build a phone operating system that even they themselves cannot crack -- God's own unmovable stone. It becomes not their problem any more.

And that is the precedent Apple hopes to establish.




1. <span id="footnote-one-fbi-apple"></span>How does one become a privacy advocate? Do you just adopt a pro-privacy position and hang around waiting for the media to call? Is it possible to become an anti-privacy advocate?
2. <span id="footnote-two-fbi-apple"></span>There's something built into the American nature that thinks "getting away with it" should be a possibility. Things like speed cameras that always catch speeders somehow seem more unfair than a cop making random stops. In reality random stops are far more unfair.
3. <span id="footnote-four-fbi-apple"></span>Exit polls suggest dinner will be antelope.
4. <span id="footnote-three-fbi-apple"></span>I suspect that Tim Cook's private life -- a gay man during a time when it was largely unapproved of -- while working is such a public role makes him actually value privacy in a real way.
